Presidential elections were held in Finland on 28 January 2024, with a second
round held on 11 February.[1] Voters elected a president of the Republic for a
six-year term. Incumbent president Sauli Niinistö was term-limited and
ineligible to run for re-election, having served the maximum two terms,
ensuring that the president elected would be the country's thirteenth.[2]

Had the new president been elected in the first round on 28 January by winning
more than half of valid votes cast, their term would have begun on 1 February.
However, as no candidate received a majority of votes, Alexander Stubb and
Pekka Haavisto contested in a runoff on 11 February with Stubb winning 51.6%
to Haavisto's 48.4%. The result in the second round was the closest in the
history of presidential elections in Finland, followed by the 2000
presidential runoff.[3] Stubb began his term as president on 1 March.[4]

## Background

[edit]

The presidential election was the first in Finland since it joined the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 2023 in response to the Russian
invasion of Ukraine, ending decades of neutrality in foreign policy. The
decision was supported by the outgoing president Sauli Niinistö, whose
constitutional position also makes him the commander-in-chief of the Finnish
Defence Forces and gives him responsibility for defence and foreign policy
affairs. Niinistö, who is the only Finnish president to have been elected with
an outright majority (62.7 percent) in the first round of voting in a direct
popular election during his reelection in 2018, enjoyed over 90 percent
popularity ratings since 2021. He rejected efforts by a citizen movement to
allow him to run for a third term.[5] An estimated 4.5 million people are
eligible to vote in the 2024 election.[6]

## Candidates

[edit]

According to the Constitution of Finland, the president must be a natural-born
Finnish citizen.[7] In order to vote in the election, the person must be a
Finnish citizen and at least 18 years of age.[8] A candidate may be nominated
by a registered political party that has secured at least a single
representative in the parliament in the preceding parliamentary election, by a
constituency association that has gathered at least 20 000 signatures from
eligible voters, or both. The whole country acts as a single constituency.[9]

### Confirmed candidates

[edit]

Out of the nine confirmed candidates, three were officially running as
constituency association candidates, although two also received the nomination
of their respective parties. The rest were nominated by a political party.[10]

## Campaign

[edit]

### Mika Aaltola

[edit]

Mika Aaltola, the director of Finnish Institute of International Affairs,
announced his candidacy on 3 August 2023.[17] He is running as an independent
candidate, and therefore must assemble 20,000 signatures from qualified voters
to establish a constituency association in order to run for the presidency.
Aaltola emerged as a surprise candidate in a presidential survey published by
Yle on 28 March 2022.[18] On 27 May 2022, similar results were obtained from a
survey conducted by _Ilta-Sanomat_.[19] Aaltola commented that he was humbled
by the results and that "In a situation where the candidates would solely
represent Finlandization and behind-the-scenes dealings, I would feel a
calling to attempt the impossible for the benefit of my homeland. Therefore,
my stance would entirely depend on the candidate lineup."[20]

In a subsequent survey published by _Ilta-Sanomat_ on 21 October 2022, Aaltola
had unexpectedly risen to the top.[21] After the results, Aaltola stated:
"There is a one percent chance that I will become the President of Finland."
He did not completely rule out his candidacy and stated that he would announce
a possible candidacy at a later time.[22] On 31 October 2022, Aaltola tweeted:
"I am not currently running for any position. My focus is on the ongoing war
and the geopolitical challenges of the winter."[23] On 4 November 2022,
_Helsingin Sanomat_ published a comprehensive personal profile and interview
with Aaltola. Many of the sources interviewed in the article noted that
Aaltola no longer behaves like an expert but rather speaks like a preacher or
a politician.[24] The same day Aaltola tweeted, that "I have no intention of
running for the presidential elections."[25]

On 11 April 2023, Aaltola tweeted that "My support in presidential surveys
remains persistently encouraging, even though I have stated a practical "no"
on multiple occasions. This was based on the fact that it is practically
impossible [to win] outside of political parties. Should I reconsider the
matter in the autumn if the support persists?"[26] In the presidential poll
commissioned by Yle in May 2023, Aaltola was the favorite as the next
president of around 13% of the respondents.[16] On 10 October 2023 Mika
Aaltola's support association announced that they had collected 25,000
endorsement cards for Aaltola, exceeding the required 20,000 endorsement card
threshold for candidacy.[27]

### Li Andersson

[edit]

Li Andersson, the leader of the Left Alliance and former Minister of
Education, announced her candidacy on 13 September 2023.[28] She was confirmed

### Sari Essayah

### Pekka Haavisto

for the Green League, announced his candidacy on 8 June 2023. Haavisto has run
for the office twice before, in 2012 and 2018, both times finishing second
behind the incumbent President Sauli Niinistö. Haavisto is running as an
independent candidate in the presidential elections. The collection of
signatures in support of Haavisto began immediately on the same day he
announced his candidacy.[31]

According to multiple polls, Haavisto is currently the leading candidate for
the presidency. He is the most popular candidate among women and younger
voters, as well as across party lines. In the presidential poll commissioned
by Yle in May 2023, Haavisto was the favorite as the next president of around
28% percent of the respondents.[16] In a presidential survey published by
Ilta-Sanomat on 13 June 2023, which aimed to determine the potential result of
a hypothetical second round in the presidential elections, Haavisto emerged as
the winner when compared to all the other major potential candidates.[32]

On 3 October 2023, Haavisto's campaign announced that they had so far
collected 48,000 endorsement cards, exceeding the required 20,000 endorsement
card threshold for candidacy.[33] Should Haavisto win the election, he would
be the first openly gay person to become President of Finland.[34]

### Jussi Halla-aho

[edit]

Jussi Halla-aho, the Speaker of the Parliament of Finland and a Member of
Parliament for the Finns Party, announced his candidacy on 7 July 2023.[35]
His candidacy was confirmed by the party congress in August.[36] In a survey
conducted by Uutissuomalainen in January 2023 among party delegates, over 80
percent of respondents considered Halla-aho the most suitable presidential
candidate for the party. In a similar survey conducted in summer 2021, Halla-
aho ranked behind Laura Huhtasaari.[37] In the presidential poll commissioned
by Yle in May 2023, Halla-aho was the favorite as the next president of around
6% of the respondents.[16]

### Hjallis Harkimo

[edit]

Hjallis Harkimo, a businessman and the chairman of his own political party
Movement Now, was elected as the party's presidential candidate on 18 June
2022.[38] Harkimo became well known in Finland as the owner of the ice hockey
team Jokerit and as the face of the TV show "Diili", the Finnish version of
_The Apprentice_. In the presidential poll commissioned by Yle in May 2023,
Harkimo was the favorite as the next president of around 1% of the
respondents.[16]

### Olli Rehn

[edit]

Olli Rehn, the Governor of the Bank of Finland and a member of the Centre
Party, announced his bid for the presidency on 21 June 2023.[39] Rehn is
running as an independent candidate in the elections. The collection of
signatures took place at events across the country during the summer of
2023.[40] In the presidential poll commissioned by Yle in May 2023, Rehn was
the favorite as the next president of around 15% of the respondents.[16] On 15
September 2023, Rehn's campaign announced that they have collected the
required 20,000 endorsement cards for candidacy.[41]

### Alexander Stubb

[edit]

Alexander Stubb, the former Prime Minister of Finland and a Member of
Parliament for the National Coalition Party, announced his candidacy on 16
August 2023, after he had been formally asked to be the party's presidential
candidate.[42] In the presidential poll commissioned by Yle in May 2023, Stubb
was the favorite as the next president of around 5% of the
respondents.[16][43] When asked about the most preferred candidate of the
National Coalition Party, Stubb was the favorite of 40% of the respondents,
while Minister of Defence Antti Häkkänen was preferred by 16%, former MP Risto
E. J. Penttilä by 9% and Minister for Foreign Affairs Elina Valtonen by
8%.[44]

### Jutta Urpilainen

[edit]

Jutta Urpilainen, the Finnish European Commissioner, former minister and chair
of the Social Democratic Party, was frequently mentioned as a possible
candidate for the SDP. On 16 August 2023, the chairman of the Social
Democratic Party Sanna Marin asked Urpilainen to run in the 2024 presidential
election as the party's candidate. Urpilainen promised to announce her
decision only in November 2023.[45] The leadership of the SDP had hoped
Urpilainen to be a candidate already in the 2018 presidential elections, but
she declined the candidacy citing family reasons.[46] On 19 November 2023,
Urpilainen announced her candidacy.[47] This led senior party officials to use
life-size cutouts of her in campaign sorties before she began personally
campaigning in December 2023.[48] In the presidential poll commissioned by Yle
in May 2023, Urpilainen was the favorite as the next president of around 2% of
the respondents.[16]

### Expenditure

[edit]

Financial disclosures released after the election showed that Alexander
Stubb's campaign team spent 2.7 million euros during the election period and
received 1.2 million euros in private donations, 610,000 euros from businesses
and around 710,000 euros from the National Coalition Party. Pekka Haavisto's
campaign was found to have spent 1.9 million and received about 1.3 million
euros from individual donors, 310,000 euros from the corporate sector, and
160,000 euros from the Green League.[49]

## Electoral issues

[edit]

The electoral campaign has mostly been dominated by international and security
issues that have risen since the country's accession to NATO in 2023,
particularly relations with Russia.[50] All nine candidates in the first round
expressed hard stances on relations with Moscow, with Jussi Halla-aho and
Alexander Stubb supporting the idea of revoking Finnish citizenship from dual
Russian-Finnish nationals. Halla-aho also supported pushing back migrants at
the Finnish-Russian border in response to gatherings of migrants to the area
that were suspected to have been orchestrated by the Russian government.[51]
Pekka Haavisto supported the closure of the border with Russia, but expressed
concern about how the influx of migrants has been used to justify rhetoric
against asylum seekers.[52] Stubb also expressed support for the deployment of
nuclear weapons in Finland, while Haavisto objected to the idea as well as
that of the remilitarization of Åland.[53]

In response to an ongoing massive strike that began during the election
campaign, Stubb distanced himself from his National Coalition Party's support
for employers and employees' freedom to settle disputes locally and said he
would not interfere with labor market issues as president. Haavisto said he
would try to bring the parties together for behind-the-scenes
negotiations.[54]

#### Additional

[edit]

A poll commissioned by the University of Helsinki to find voters' reasons for
not choosing specific candidates that was conducted before the first round of
voting found that a third of respondents said they would not support
Haavisto's candidacy on account of his same-sex Ecuadorian partner, Antonio
Flores, with university professor Jaakko Hillo noting that most of those who
cited this as an issue were more likely to describe themselves as right-wing
conservatives.[83]

## Youth election

[edit]

The Finnish National Youth Council, or Allianssi, held a mock election between
8 January and 12 January for people under the age of 18. The participants
included among others schools and local youth councils from 198 different
municipalities. Number of votes cast was a record 94,456, and the results were
as follows:[84]

Candidate  | Share of votes (%)   
---|---  
Alexander Stubb  | 21.52   
Jussi Halla-aho  | 20.84   
Pekka Haavisto  | 13.96   
Li Andersson  | 12.19   
Hjallis Harkimo  | 9.52   
Jutta Urpilainen  | 5.73   
Olli Rehn  | 4.94   
Mika Aaltola  | 3.57   
Sari Essayah  | 2.34   
  
## Disinformation

[edit]

In the days leading up to the vote, some Finns Party supporters accused the
public broadcaster Yle of being biased against Jussi Halla-aho, prompting
Yle's CEO to respond that "Yle does not campaign against or for anyone."
Several of Halla-aho's rivals also defended the broadcaster, with Jutta
Urpilainen describing the allegations as the "international trend of right-
wing populists questioning elections for their own gain arriving in Finland as
well", and Pekka Haavisto saying that there were no "signs of outside
interference despite concerns regarding that". Dimitri Qvintus, a Social
Democrat party official and spokesperson for former prime minister Sanna
Marin, said that the allegations "would fit perfectly with the new Finns Party
playbook" of trying to promote doubt in the election results in the event that
Halla-aho loses the election, adding that the government should have
immediately addressed these claims.[85]

Fake posters appeared in tram stops in Helsinki, in which images of Jussi
Halla-aho were altered to include phrases such as "Fascist Halla-aho" and
"Finland must be a safe space for Nazis." An altered poster of Haavisto was
also displayed with a falsely-attributed quote.[86]

## Voting

[edit]

### First round

[edit]

Early voting opened on 17 January,[87] with turnout estimated at 44

overseas polling stations that were set up in Finnish diplomatic missions was
conducted from 17 to 20 January,[91] during which 58,757 out of an estimated
263,000 eligible Finnish citizens abroad voted, an increase of 6,253 from
2018.[92] In the first round of voting on 28 January, polling stations opened
at 09:00,[89] and closed at 20:00.[93] Initial results are expected at around

January.[94]

### Second round

[edit]

For the runoff, early voting was held from 31 January to 6 February while

Following the result of the first round, Alexander Stubb said: "We have at
this stage gotten the kind of result for which we can be grateful and humble."
Pekka Haavisto described his showing as "a really great result." Jussi Halla-
aho said that he had to be "satisfied" with the result, noting that it had
been "better" than what he had expected. It was the Finns party's best
presidential election result in history. Olli Rehn expressed thanks to the
voters. Mika Aaltola said that he was happy that foreign and security policy
were on the electoral agenda but said that it would take some time before he
would "take on something like this again." Rehn, Sari Essayah, and Harry
Harkimo declined to endorse any candidate in the runoff, with Essayah saying
that "citizens can vote according to their preference," and Harkimo saying
that both Stubb and Haavisto "have the same opinions about everything."[97]

Following the result of the second round, Haavisto conceded defeat to Stubb
and publicly shook hands with him at Helsinki City Hall. In response, Stubb
expressed appreciation and pride at having been "able to run" with him.[98] He
also called his victory as "the greatest honour" of his life.[99]

## Reactions

[edit]

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy congratulated Stubb on his victory and
said that he was looking forward "to advancing our relations and our shared
vision of a free, united, and well-defended Europe".[100]
