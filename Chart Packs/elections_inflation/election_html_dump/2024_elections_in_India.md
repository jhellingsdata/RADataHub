## Notes

[edit]

  1. **^** The seat fell vacant due to the death of sitting MLA Sadhan Pande on 20th February 2022. However, bypolls to the seat couldn't be held even after 6 months of Pande's death (according to Indian law) because BJP candidate Kalyan Chaubey filed an election petition in the Calcutta High Court alleging irregularities in polling & demanded a recount of votes. The Representation of the People Act, 1951 forbids holding any polls to the seat until any election petition concerning that seat hasn't been resolved at the court.[53] On 29 April 2024, Choubey withdrew his election petition from the court, making way for bypoll to the seat.[54]
