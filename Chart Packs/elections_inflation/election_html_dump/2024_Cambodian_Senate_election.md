Senate elections were held in Cambodia on 25 February 2024.[1][2] These were
the fifth Senate elections in the country's history.

## Background

[edit]

After resigning as prime minister in 2023, Hun Sen stated his intention to
continue his political career as the President of the Cambodian People's Party
(CPP), a member of the National Assembly, and the President of the Supreme
Privy Council. After the Senate election on 25 February 2024, he announced his
intention to also become President of the Senate.[3] In recent years, major
opposition parties to Hun Sen's regime have been prevented from contesting
elections due to controversial court rulings.[4] In the previous Senate
elections in 2018, the CPP won all contested seats in the chamber after the
dissolution of its main rival, the Cambodia National Rescue Party, which was
believed to have been engineered by the government.[5]

On 5 September 2023, the Candlelight Party (CLP) was advised by the National
Election Committee (NEC) to make every effort to locate the original
registration document issued by the Ministry of Interior or obtain a new one
in order to be eligible to vote in the Senate election. NEC spokesman Hang
Puthea suggested that CLP leaders should try to locate the missing original
paperwork or appeal to the Ministry of Interior to follow the legal process in
order to obtain a new original document to register the candidates and parties
at the NEC. According to CLP spokesman Kimsour Phirith, party officials wrote
to Interior Minister Sar Sokha to address the issue with the party's
registration documentation. According to him, the party is still exerting
significant effort to request that the Ministry of Interior streamline the
procedure and make it simpler for political parties to register.[6]

## Electoral system

[edit]

The Senate of Cambodia is elected every 6 years by an indirect party-list
proportional representation through 8 multi-member constituencies (regions),
with the Communal Chiefs, Communal Councilors, and members of the National
Assembly.[7]

## Conduct

[edit]

### Allegations of irregularities

[edit]

The Candlelight party alleged that its local councilors were targeted by
attempts at intimidation and vote-buying. It added that provincial authorities
aligned to the CPP were visiting Candlelight councilors asking them to stay
away from polling stations or bribe them to vote for the CPP. The latter
denied the claims, describing them as a "distortion of the facts."[14]

## Results

[edit]

Preliminary results released by the NEC showed that the CPP had won 55 of the
58 contested seats in the Senate, with the remaining four seats being filled
by appointees of King Norodom Sihamoni and the National Assembly. The other
three contested seats were won by the Khmer Will Party, a coalition of parties
opposed to Hun Sen and a proxy of the Candlelight Party.[14][4] It also showed
that the opposition had lost ground in Phnom Penh to the CPP by nearly half of
its votes and by 30 percent in the surrounding Kandal Province.[14]

## Reactions

[edit]

CPP spokesperson Sok Eysan said that the election results were better than
expected for the party and said that it was likely that Hun Sen would become
the new Senate president once the official results are released by the NEC in
April.[4] Hun Sen was officially sworn in as Senate President following a
unanimous vote by the chamber on 3 April.[16]

Exiled opposition leader Sam Rainsy said that the minor opposition gains in
the election were encouraging signs for democracy and a victory despite
challenges such as fear, threats and vote-buying.[4]

## Notes

[edit]

  1. **^** Khmer Will Party named Son Chhay as its leading candidate, however Kong Molika was the central leading figure throughout the election.
