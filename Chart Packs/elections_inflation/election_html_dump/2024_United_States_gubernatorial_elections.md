**United States gubernatorial elections** are currently being held on November
5, 2024, in 11 states and two territories. The previous gubernatorial
elections for this group of states took place in 2020, except in New Hampshire
and Vermont, where governors only serve two-year terms and elected their
governors in 2022. In addition to state gubernatorial elections, the
territories of American Samoa and Puerto Rico will also hold elections for
their governors.

The elections will take place concurrently with the 2024 presidential
election, elections to the House of Representatives and Senate, and numerous
state and local elections. This will be the first election cycle since 2017
that no incumbent Democratic governors will be running for re-election.[a]
With the primary defeat of Puerto Rico governor Pedro Pierluisi, this is also
the first cycle since 2020 in which an incumbent governor lost renomination,
also in Puerto Rico. This is the first election cycle since 2011 in which
there was no change in state governorships held by either party.

## Partisan composition

[edit]

Going into the election, there are 27 Republican governors and 23 Democratic
governors in the United States. This class of governors is made up of 8
Republicans and 3 Democrats. Republicans are defending two governorships in
states that Joe Biden won in 2020 (New Hampshire and Vermont) while Democrats
are defending one governorship in a state that Donald Trump won in 2020 (North
Carolina).[1]

## Election predictions

[edit]

Several sites and individuals published predictions of competitive seats.
These predictions looked at factors such as the strength of the incumbent (if
the incumbent is running for re-election), the strength of the candidates, and
the partisan leanings of the state (reflected in part by the state's Cook
Partisan Voting Index rating). The predictions assigned ratings to each seat,
with the rating indicating a party's predicted advantage in winning that seat.

Most election predictors use:

  * "_tossup_ ": no advantage
  * "_tilt_ " (used by some predictors): advantage that is not quite as strong as "lean"
  * "_lean_ ": slight advantage
  * "_likely_ ": significant, but surmountable, advantage
  * "_safe_ " or "_solid_ ": near-certain chance of victory

Governor Doug Burgum was re-elected to a second term in 2020 with 65.8% of the

sworn into office after the amendment's effective date of January 1, 2023.[24]
Burgum, sworn into office before the amendment's effective date, remained
eligible to run for re-election for a third term. Burgum initially ran for the

dropped out before the primaries. On January 22, 2024, he announced he would

won the Republican nomination and defeated Lieutenant Governor Tammy
Miller.[9]

On the other side, state Senator Merrill Piepkorn won the Democratic

Governor Phil Scott won re-election to a fourth two-year term in 2022. Because
Vermont does not have gubernatorial term limits in its constitution, he is
eligible to run for re-election for a fifth term in 2024, and has announced
that he will do so.[27] Scott won the August 12 primary unopposed and will
face educator Esther Charlestin in the general election.[28]

Washington Governor Jay Inslee was re-elected to a third term in 2020 with
56.6% of the vote. Because Washington does not have gubernatorial term limits
in its constitution, he is eligible to run for re-election for a fourth term,
but he has decided not to seek re-election.[29] State Attorney General Bob
Ferguson won the Democratic nomination.[30][31] In the Republican primary,
former U.S. representative Dave Reichert won the nomination.[32][33]

running for the United States Senate.

[edit]

Main article: 2024 American Samoan general election

Lemanu Peleti Mauga was elected Governor in the 2020 general election with
60.3% of the vote. On April 10, 2024, Mauga and incumbent Lieutenant Governor
Eleasalo Ale announced their campaign for reelection under the slogan "E
Lavatia le Alofa” — "Love Beareth All."[40] Prior to Magua's announcement,
Paramount Chief Mauga Tasi Asuega was advocating for the Governor's
reelection.[41] Pula T. I. Nikolao Pula, former Director of the Office of
Insular Affairs, announced his candidacy on March 4, 2024.[42] Pula announced
High Chief Pulu Ae Ae Jr., a former faipule for Maʻopūtasi County as his
running mate.[41]

Governor Pedro Pierluisi was elected in 2020 with 32.9% of the vote. He
announced his re-election campaign on March 20, 2022, during the New
Progressive Party's general assembly.[43] However, he was defeated by
Jenniffer González-Colón, the resident commissioner, in the New Progressive
Party primary election.[13]

Territorial legislator Jesús Manuel Ortiz won the nomination of the Popular
Democratic Party.[44] Other candidates include former territorial senator Juan
Dalmau of the Alianza de País (an alliance between the Puerto Rican
Independence Party and Citizen's Victory Movement), and San Sebastián mayor
Javier Jiménez of Project Dignity. Because Citizen's Victory was required by
law to field a candidate in the governor's race, Javier Córdova Iturregui is
also on the ballot.

## Notes

[edit]

  1. **^** This figure does not include the governors of American Samoa and Puerto Rico, both of which are running for re-election. However, they only affiliate with the Democratic Party on the federal level, and associate differently on the territorial level.
  2. **^** Parson took office in 2018 after his predecessor (Eric Greitens) resigned. He was subsequently elected in the 2020 Missouri gubernatorial election.
  3. **^** Governor Jim Justice was originally elected as a Democrat before switching back to a Republican in 2017. Justice won re-election as a Republican in 2020.[12]
  4. **^** The governor of American Samoa is elected on a nonpartisan basis, although individuals do affiliate with national parties. In Mauga's case, this is with the Democratic Party.
  5. **^** Pierluisi affiliates with the Democratic Party on the national level.
