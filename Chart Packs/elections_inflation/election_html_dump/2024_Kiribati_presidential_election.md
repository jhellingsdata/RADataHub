Presidential elections were held in Kiribati on 25 October 2024, [1][2]
following parliamentary elections in August. Incumbent President Taneti Maamau
of the Tobwaan Kiribati Party was re-elected with about 55% of the vote, to
Kaotitaake Kokoria's 42%.[3] The inauguration proceeded on 1 November 2024.[4]

## Background

[edit]

The president is directly elected by plurality vote from three or four
candidates nominated by and from among members of the House of Assembly.[5][6]
The parliament sits as soon as possible after the general election to elect a
new Speaker and choose the candidates for the presidential election. If only
three or four nominations are received, the Speaker declares those members to
be the candidates for the election.[7] If more than four nominations are
received, parliament votes by secret ballot in two rounds to eliminate the
surplus nominees.[8][9] The Constitution does not (on its face) envisage a
situation where fewer than three candidates are nominated, but the 2020
Kiribati presidential election proceeded with only two candidates. This was
held to be constitutional by the High Court.[10]

### Candidate selection

[edit]

The 2024 parliamentary election resulted in a supermajority for the ruling
Tobwaan Kiribati Party, which was then able to block the nomination of
opposition party candidates for the presidential election when parliament sat
on 13 September 2024. The TKP nominated incumbent president Taneti Maamau,
alongside three other members of the TKP described as "dummy candidates":
Bautaake Beia from Washington (Teraina), Riteta Iorome from Onotoa, and
Kaotitaake Kokoria from Fanning (Tabuaeran), all first-time members of
parliament.[11][12]

Opposition leader Tessie Lambourne decried the move, saying "Kiribati is now a
one-party state."[13]

## Campaign

[edit]

On 30 September 2024 the manifestos of three of the candidates were
published.[14][15] It was later reported that candidate Riteta Iorome had
withdrawn.[16]

Opposition figures, including former president Ieremia Tabai, called for a
boycott of the election, in protest at the exclusion of opposition
candidates.[17] Prior to the election being held, Kaotitaake Kokoria defected
away from the TKP to form a new alliance, with the support of two other
MPs.[18] Taneti Maamau was widely expected to retain his position.[11]
