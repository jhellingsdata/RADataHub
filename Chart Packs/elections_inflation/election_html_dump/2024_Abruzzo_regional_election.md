The **2024 Abruzzo regional election** took place on 10 March 2024. The
election was for all 29 elected seats of the Regional Council of Abruzzo, as
well as the president of Abruzzo who, along with the second placed
presidential candidate, automatically became members of the Regional Council.
It was the second election of the 2024 Italian regional elections.

The election was won by the centre-right coalition's incumbent president,
Marco Marsilio of Brothers of Italy, over the independent centre-left
coalition candidate, Luciano D'Amico, an economist and professor at the
University of Teramo, 53.5% to 46.5%. The centre-left coalition, which remains
divided at the national level but came from an upset win and gain in the 2024
Sardinian regional election, included both the Five Star Movement and the
Action and Italia Viva parties. Despite this combination, known as _campo
larghissimo_ , it was not enough for the opposition to win in Abruzzo,
although it lost by 7% in what was the fourth most right-wing region of Italy.

## Background

[edit]

In the 2019 Abruzzo regional election, Marco Marsilio and the centre-right
coalition won over the Democratic Party and centre-left coalition candidate
Giovanni Legnini 48.0% to 31.3%, with 20.2% of the votes going to the Five
Star Movement candidate Sara Marcozzi, who later in July 2023 joined Forza
Italia within the centre-right coalition.[1][2] In January 2022, the election
was called for 10 March 2024.[3]

## Electoral system

[edit]

The electoral law is based on proportional representation and is thus
proportional to the share of the votes each party receives, with an electoral
threshold of 4% of the vote for parties that are not members of coalitions and
2% for those included in a coalition. The election of the Regional Council
occurs on a regional basis within the four districts of Abruzzo, coinciding
with the four provinces of the region. The district of Chieti elects eight
councilors, while Pescara, L'Aquila, and Teramo each elect seven councillors.
The president of the Regional Council and the presidential candidate who
received the second largest number of votes also become members of the
regional council. The candidate who obtains the majority of valid votes at the
regional level becomes president. Every candidate must be linked to a party
list or an electoral coalition running for the Regional Council. A majority of
60% to 65% of the seats is then allocated to the party or coalition of the
elected president.[4]
