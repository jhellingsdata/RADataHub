Legislative elections were held in France on 30 June and 7 July 2024 (and one
day earlier for some voters outside of metropolitan France) to elect all 577
members of the 17th National Assembly of the Fifth French Republic. The
election followed the dissolution of the National Assembly by President
Emmanuel Macron, triggering a snap election after the National Rally (RN) made
substantial gains and Macron's _Besoin d'Europe_ electoral list lost a
significant number of seats in the 2024 European Parliament election in
France.[4]

In the first round of the election, the RN and candidates jointly backed by
Éric Ciotti of The Republicans (LR) led with 33.21% of the vote, followed by
the parties of the New Popular Front (NFP) with 28.14%,[b] the pro-Macron
alliance Ensemble with 21.28%,[c] and LR candidates with 6.57%, with an
overall turnout of 66.71%, the highest since 1997.[2][5] On the basis of these
results, a record 306 constituencies were headed to three-way runoffs and 5 to
four-way runoffs,[6] but 134 NFP and 82 Ensemble candidates withdrew despite
qualifying for the run-off in order to reduce the RN's chances of winning an
absolute majority of seats.[7][8]

In the second round, based on the Interior Ministry's candidate labeling, NFP
candidates won 180 seats,[b] with the Ensemble coalition winning 159,[c] RN-
supported candidates being elected to 142, and LR candidate taking 39 seats.
Since no party reached the requisite 289 seats needed for a majority, the
second round resulted in a hung parliament. Unofficial media classifications
of candidates' affiliations may differ slightly from those used by the
Ministry of Interior: according to _Le Monde_ 's analysis, 182 NFP-affiliated
candidates were elected, compared with 168 for Ensemble, 143 for the RN, and
45 for LR.[3][2] The turnout for the second round, 66.63%, likewise set the
record for being the highest since 1997.

Macron initially refused Gabriel Attal's resignation on 8 July, but accepted
the resignation of the government on 16 July, allowing ministers to vote for
the president of the National Assembly while remaining in place as a caretaker
government. NFP leaders called for the appointment of a prime minister from
the left, but Ensemble and LR figures advocated for an alliance and threatened
that any NFP-led government including ministers from La France Insoumise (LFI)
would face an immediate vote of no confidence. Post-election negotiations
between NFP alliance partners exposed renewed tensions, with party leaders
taking until 23 July to agree upon a name for prime minister – the 37-year-old
director of finance and purchasing for the city of Paris, Lucie Castets.
Macron announced a truce for making political negotiations during the 2024
Summer Olympics on 26 July to 11 August. After the truce, Macron still did not
signal any intent to appoint her and called party leaders meeting in Élysée on
23 August, he finally refused to do so on 27 August, leading the NFP to
announce they would not take part in further talks with Macron unless it was
"to discuss forming a government".[9]

On 5 September, Macron appointed Michel Barnier as prime minister. He
presented his government on 19 September and announced on 22 September. On 1
October, Barnier presented his first speech in the National Assembly. [10]
Analysts noted that the failure of any bloc to attain support from an absolute
majority of deputies could lead to institutional deadlock because any
government must be able to survive motions of no confidence against them.
Although Macron can call a second snap election, he is unable to do so until
at least a year after the 2024 election, as stipulated by the constitution. On
9 October, Barnier survived a motion of no confidence led by 193 members of
the NFP and 4 members of LIOT members support.[_citation needed_]

## Background

[edit]

Following the 2022 legislative election, Ensemble lost its absolute majority
in the National Assembly. Among the member parties of the coalition was
President Emmanuel Macron's party, Renaissance (formerly La République En
Marche!). Meanwhile, the two main opposition blocs, the left-wing New
Ecological and Social People's Union (NUPES) and far-right National Rally (RN)
made significant gains in terms of seats. Despite that, no group won the
absolute majority, resulting in a hung parliament for the first time since the
1988 election.[11] The lack of an absolute majority led to the repeated
invocation of article 49.3 of the constitution in order to adopt legislation,
with Élisabeth Borne doing so 23 times by December 2023.[12]

On 9 June 2024, shortly after 21:00 CEST, Macron dissolved the National
Assembly and called snap elections in a national address following projections
which indicated that the L'Europe Ensemble electoral list would be
significantly eclipsed by the RN in the European Parliament elections in
France. In his address, he called the rise of nationalism by agitators a
threat to France, Europe, and France's place in the world. He also warned that
the far-right would bring about the "impoverishment of the French people and
the downfall of our country." The dates of the first and second rounds of
elections were set for 30 June and 7 July, respectively.[13]

### Reactions to the announcement

[edit]

#### Politicians

[edit]

RN leader Jordan Bardella called the large gap between the RN and L'Europe
Ensemble electoral lists in the European Parliament elections a "stinging
disavowal" of President Macron, saying that the results marked "day 1 of the
post-Macron era."[14] Marine Le Pen, president of the RN group in the National
Assembly, and Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of La France Insoumise, celebrated
the election results and welcomed the announcement of snap elections.[13]

Former president Nicolas Sarkozy condemned Macron, seeing his decision to
dissolve parliament as a "serious risk for the country."[15] Mayor of Paris
Anne Hidalgo reacted extremely negatively to Macron's decision, saying that
the elections posed a serious threat to the upcoming 2024 Summer Olympics
because they would not only "spoil the mood of the whole country" but also
carry the risk of street riots and demonstrations.[16]

#### Media

[edit]

The decision to hold an election came as a surprise to outside observers and
was widely seen as being risky for the presidential majority of Emmanuel
Macron, with some suggesting that Macron wished to force a decision between
the RN and their opposition and others assessing that Macron intended to win a
majority,[17][18] with Renaissance leader Stéphane Séjourné attempting to
tempt moderate incumbents on both the left and right to join his alliance in
comments made just after the dissolution was announced.[19]

Most international media expressed deep surprise at Macron's decision, calling
the snap elections a "desperate gamble." In general, Macron's decision was
perceived negatively, and the prospects for his alliance's victory in the
elections were assessed as low. _La Libre Belgique_ called Macron a "wounded
political animal."[20] According to the BBC, by calling snap elections, Macron
jeopardised the democracy of the Fifth Republic and risked provoking violence
in the streets and institutional collapse.[21] _The Guardian_ considered
Macron's measures an attempt to avenge his defeat in the preceding European
Parliament elections, which could result in radicals coming to power and
splitting the country.[22] _Die Zeit_ believed that Macron "lost his cool" to
such an extent that he actually "gave the country to Marine Le Pen." The Greek
daily newspaper _Kathimerini_ called Macron's decision an unwise gamble that
would lead to nothing good.[23] French media raised the issue of holding the
2024 Summer Olympics in conditions of political instability.[24]

## Electoral system

[edit]

Constituencies with three- or four-way runoffs  
(before candidate withdrawals)[25][26][6]

The 577 members of the National Assembly, known as deputies, are elected for
five years by a two-round system in single-member constituencies. A candidate
who receives an absolute majority of valid votes and a vote total greater than
25% of the registered electorate is elected in the first round. If no
candidate reaches this threshold, a runoff election is held between the top
two candidates plus any other candidate who received a vote total greater than
12.5% of registered voters. The candidate who receives the most votes in the
second round is elected.[27]

A consequence of the 12.5% threshold was the potential for three-way runoffs,
also referred to as trianglular elections, in a greater number of
constituencies in the second round in the event of higher turnout and
diminished number of candidates, as was anticipated to be the case in 2024
relative to previous legislative elections. Such a dynamic reinforced the
likelihood that higher turnout became an advantage for the National Rally,
which received a clear plurality of the vote in pre-first round polls and as a
result would be expected to win a greater share of seats due to the increased
number of three-way races in the second round, not accounting for the
possibility of candidate withdrawals.[28]

With pre-election polls suggesting that the 2024 legislative elections would
feature the highest level of turnout in decades with an exceptionally
tripolarised electorate, pre-election estimates of the potential number of
three-way races were also at unprecedented levels,[29] and ultimately 306
constituencies headed to three-way runoffs and 5 to four-way runoffs,[6] with
89 three-way and 2 four-way runoffs remaining after candidate withdrawals
announced ahead of the registration deadline for the second round.[7] This
marked the first time since 1973 that four-way runoffs, also referred to as
_quadrangulaires_ , were necessary in any French legislative election.[30]

## Campaign

[edit]

### Timeline

[edit]

The two rounds of the election were held on 30 June and 7 July in metropolitan
France (France, adjacent islands, Corsica), while each round took place a day
earlier in France's overseas departments (Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Saint
Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, French
Polynesia) as well as in embassies and consular posts in the Americas. Polling
stations were open from 8:00 to 18:00 local time, with some open until
20:00.[31] All media coverage in terms of candidate interviews and programmes,
campaigning, and publication of public opinion polls were banned from midnight
on the day before the election in (29 June and 6 July) to the closing of the
last polling stations on election day.[32]

The timeline for candidates to register for the first round of elections was
from 12 June until 16 June, while the candidate registration deadline for the
second round is 2 July.[33] The official campaign, during which audio-visual
and electoral regulations must be respected, began on 17 June.[34]

For those registered on consular electoral lists, online voting for
constituencies for French residents overseas ran from 25 June at 12:00 CEST to
27 June at 12:00 CEST for the first round, and from 3 July at 12:00 CEST to 4
July at 18:00 CEST for the second round. Many of those attempting to vote on
25 June reported that the voting website was unreachable due to high
traffic.[35] The Ministry for Foreign Affairs announced on 27 June that
410,000 online ballots were cast during the voting period, a new record
compared to 250,000 in 2022.[36]

The extremely short amount of time to prepare for the election posed
significant logistical challenges, especially in overseas France, due to
municipalities being required to cover the costs of organising the ballot by
themselves in addition to the necessity of recruiting and training volunteers
to run polling stations in relatively little time.[37] In a press release, the
Association of Mayors of France [fr] stated that many mayors remained worried
"about the ability of their communes to organise these two elections under
satisfactory conditions." While monetary compensation for assessors is usually
prohibited, some communes opted to ignore the electoral code given that
exceptions were granted to communes under similarly "exceptional
circumstances" in the past. Furthermore, the timing of the election made it
impossible for candidates and parties to present enough representatives
presents at polling stations, with only a tenth of those required having been
nominated in Nice. While such issues might normally be sufficient reason for
the Constitutional Council to annul election results in specific
constituencies, legal scholars considered this possibility unlikely given the
lack of time for officials to prepare for the elections.[38]

### Protests

[edit]

Manif_reims_anti_fascisme_1523908.jpg)Protests against the far-right in Reims
on 14 June

Main article: 2024 French protests against the far-right

On 9 June 2024, protests started immediately following the European election
results, where several hundred people demonstrated against the RN's victory at
Place de la République in Paris and called for a "union of the left" in the
next legislative elections and several dozen people chanting anti-Jordan
Bardella slogans in Lille.[39] Many labour unions, student groups, human
rights groups, and political parties called for rallies in order to oppose the
anti-immigration and Eurosceptic policies of National Rally, and to promote
"progressive alternatives for the world of work".[40][41] Political parties
that called for rallies included the Socialist Party, Communist Party, The
Ecologists and La France Insoumise, while union groups calling for rallies
included the French Democratic Confederation of Labour (CFDT), the General
Confederation of Labour (CGT), the National Union of Autonomous Trade Unions
(UNSA), the Fédération Syndicale Unitaire (FSU), and the Solidaires, promoting
the "largest possible" demonstrations.[41]

On 18 June, the CGT called for voters to support the left-of-centre New
Popular Front alliance, marking the first time it ever issued specific voting
instructions for a specific candidate or party.[42]

### Parties and coalitions

[edit]

#### Summary

[edit]

Below are the major parties and alliances (including any primary components
with candidates in at least 3 constituencies) contesting the elections in a
majority (289 or more as tallied by _Le Monde_) of constituencies, listed by
their combined results in the previous elections.[1]

Due to the suddenness of the dissolution of the National Assembly,
significantly fewer candidates ran in the legislative elections in 2024 as
compared to previous years, with only 4,010 candidates in 577 constituencies
(the lowest figure since the 1988 election). The decline was also due to both
national and local alliances. Smaller parties – such as the Animalist Party,
which presented 421 candidates and received 1.1% of the vote in 2022 but
announced it would not present candidates in 2024 – were the most
significantly affected due to their inability to negotiate alliances with
larger parties and present candidates in the majority of constituencies with
such short notice.[43][1]

Leftist politician François Ruffin called on all left-wing parties, including
The Ecologists (LE), to form a "popular front" in order to avoid the "worst"
outcome.[76] Calls for unity were also shared by Socialist Party (PS) leader
Olivier Faure, LE leader Marine Tondelier and French Communist Party (PCF)
leader Fabien Roussel.[77] A letter of 350 intellectuals (including Esther
Duflo and Annie Ernaux) calling for a union of left-wing forces was published
in _Le Monde_ on 10 June.[78] The New Popular Front was established on the
same day, bringing together La France Insoumise (LFI), the PS, LE, the PCF,
Place Publique, and various other political forces.[79]

On 13 June, LFI, the PS, LE, and the PCF reached an agreement on how to
allocate 546 constituencies (including metropolitan France and French voters
living abroad) between candidates of their choice, obtaining 229, 175, 92, and
50 constituencies, respectively, with these seats divided among themselves and
allied forces.[80][81] After outcry from other members of the alliance, Adrien
Quatennens, previously convicted of domestic violence, withdrew his candidacy
in Nord's 1st constituency on 16 June.[82] Several incumbent LFI deputies
critical of leader Mélenchon – Alexis Corbière, Raquel Garrido, Hendrik Davi,
and Danielle Simonnet – were not renominated in their constituencies under the
banner of the New Popular Front, a decision critiqued both by their supporters
and other party leaders within the alliance. Nevertheless, the four candidates
maintained their candidacies against LFI opponents in their constituencies.
Frédéric Mathieu, another Mélenchon critic within LFI, was also not
renominated and opted not to run for re-election.[83]

The coalition unveiled its campaign platform on 14 June, which included
overturning Macron's pension, unemployment, education, immigration, police,
guaranteed minimum income, and universal national service reforms, as well as
his cuts to funding for low-income housing and his merger of French nuclear
safety organisations; lowering the retirement age to 60 in the longer-term;
implementing price freezes on essential food, energy, and gas; raising the
minimum wage to €1,600 per month (representing a 14% increase) and
personalised housing assistance by 10%; moving towards a 32-hour work week for
arduous or night shift jobs; conditioning government support for businesses on
adherence to environmental, social, and anti-discriminatory regulations;
reserving workers one-third of seats on boards of directors; increasing
financial transaction taxes; banning bank financing for fossil fuels;
nationalising control over water; reforming the generalised social
contribution and inheritance taxes (capping the latter), as well as nearly
tripling the number of income tax brackets from 5 to 14, to make them more
progressive; re-instituting a solidarity tax on wealth "with a climate
component"; enacting an exit tax on funds withdrawn from the country; charging
a vehicle miles traveled tax on imports; guaranteeing a price floor for
agricultural products; cancelling the Comprehensive Economic and Trade
Agreement and any future free trade treaties; and forbidding the imports of
agricultural products which do not meet domestic social and environmental
standards.[84]

Other key NFP proposals included raising the image and salaries of public
healthcare, education, justice, and government jobs; strengthening the
industrial sector in key strategic areas; establishing the right to menstrual
leave; prohibiting new major highway projects; outlawing intensive animal
farming and the usage of all PFASs, neonicotinoids, and glyphosate; re-
examining the Common Agricultural Policy; providing partial or full government
financing for home insulation; creating free public water fountains, showers,
and toilets; constructing 200,000 new public housing units per year; requiring
mandatory rent control in high-rent areas; introducing proportional
representation; removing article 49.3 from the constitution; outlawing the
usage of blast balls by riot police; continuing to supply weapons to defend
Ukraine; recognising the state of Palestine along with Israel; and demanding
compliance with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) order against Israel
and ceasing support for Benjamin Netanyahu's government.[84]

Opponents of the New Popular Front exploited uncertainty around who would be
appointed prime minister in the event of the victory of the left, warning of
the threat of Jean-Luc Mélenchon's appointment given his refusal to recuse
himself from the post; although on 22 June he said that he would be willing to
be appointed prime minister, he claimed that he would "not impose" himself,
even as numerous other potential appointees' names have circulated.[85] Other
figures on the left, while reluctant to address the question of who they
believed should be prime minister, were taken aback by his comments: former
president François Hollande, running in Corrèze's 1st constituency, opined
that Mélenchon should "keep his mouth shut," former prime minister Lionel
Jospin said that he was hearing "just about everywhere, and particularly from
voters of the left" that "Jean-Luc Mélenchon is not the solution," Fabien
Roussel released a statement saying that "Mélenchon's nomination for the post
of prime minister, [speculation about which] he himself is feeding into, has
never been subject of an agreement between the forces of the Popular Front,"
Marine Tondelier, interviewed on LCI about Mélenchon's remarks, painted a
generic portrait of the attributes of the ideal prime minister, ending with
"and lastly, someone who unites."[86][87] In a pre-election Elabe poll, only
16% of respondents – including just 49% of Mélenchon's 2022 voters, 24% of
supporters of green parties and 17% of Socialist Party supporters – indicated
they would be supportive of his appointment as prime minister, compared to 83%
against the idea.[88]

Infighting broke out into the open on 24 June, starting with PCF leader Fabien
Roussel's comments in the morning, "I say this to Jean-Luc Mélenchon: no one
can proclaim himself Prime Minister," to which he added that the New Popular
Front needed "the most unifying personality" to lead them in the incoming
National Assembly which, according to him, would clearly not be Mélenchon,[89]
comments also echoed by Faure.[90] Those remarks were followed by Tondelier
declaring that Mélenchon would not be prime minister, and that any prime
minister would have to be chosen by consensus between the forces of the New
Popular Front, but she was almost immediately rebuked by LFI national
coordinator Manuel Bompard, who argued that "nobody can decide to exclude"
Mélenchon.[91] In back-to-back evening interviews on France 2, Place Publique
co-founder and MEP Raphaël Glucksmann, echoed Tondelier's comments in
declaring definitively that "Mélenchon will not be prime minister," even as
Mélenchon told Hollande to "shut up" in response to his comments the previous
day, complained that the speculation was due to "jealousy" of others on the
left, and lamented the fact that he had to cede 100 additional constituencies
to PS candidates compared to the New Ecological and Social People's Union
(NUPES) in 2022 because Glucksmann's list outpolled the LFI list in the
preceding European elections.[92] Interviewed on 26 June, Faure said Mélenchon
would not be prime minister, and the latter chided his alliance partners'
"petty" bickering and reaffirmed that any decisions about who would become
prime minister would only be made after the elections, but did not close the
door to the possibility of him seeking the post, saying "there are those who
don't like me and others who do like me."[93] On 1 July, LFI deputy Sophia
Chikirou declared that "it will be either Mélenchon at Matignon, or another"
LFI member if they constitute a majority of left-of-centre elected officials,
owing to her feeling that other members of the alliance were indebted to
them.[94]

#### Ensemble

[edit]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Gabriel_Attal_2023_%28cropped%29.jpg/170px-

The Ensemble coalition of Renaissance, the Democratic Movement (MoDem),
Horizons, the Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI), and the Radical Party
was renewed after swift negotiations soon after the dissolution
announcement.[95][96]

Just after the early election was called, Secretary General of Renaissance
Stéphane Séjourné announced that the presidential majority would field
candidates against "other republican candidates" in the hopes of splitting his
opposition, with Clément Beaune naturally excluding La France Insoumise (LFI)
and the National Rally (RN) from that definition.[19] The alliance ultimately
chose not to field candidates in 67 constituencies, many of which were
represented by incumbents of The Republicans (LR), and several others from the
Socialist Party (PS) as well as members of the Liberties, Independents,
Overseas and Territories (LIOT) group in the National Assembly.[97] On 12
June, Emmanuel Macron said that he had called the election to prevent a far-
right victory in the 2027 presidential election. He criticised The Republicans
for its potential alliance with the RN, as well as the New Popular Front
(NFP), and urged all parties "able to say no to extremes" to unite.[98]

In an open letter published on 23 June, Macron wrote that he hoped that "the
future government [would gather] republicans of diverse sensibilities who will
be known for their courage to oppose the extremes," in acknowledgement of the
possibility of a post-election coalition. Additionally, in response to
speculation that he might resign, he affirmed that he would remain president
until May 2027.[99] Most – but not all – constitutional experts rejected the
possibility of Macron resigning in order to avoid potential legislative
deadlock in the event of an unclear election outcome (with legislative
elections prohibited within a year of the preceding one), considering that
article 6 of the constitution explicitly prohibits presidents from serving
more than two consecutive terms, and such a scenario would entail him seeking
a third given that his current term would consider to have ended after such a
resignation.[100]

On 20 June, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal pledged to lower electricity bills
and inheritance taxes, link pensions to inflation, and provide aid to first-
time property buyers.[101] Other proposals he presented included raising the
value-sharing bonus by up to €10,000 per year, constructing 14 new nuclear
reactors, banning access to social networks to those aged 15 and under,
halving the usage of pesticides by 2030, and doubling the army budget by
2030.[102] Echoing the RN's proposals in response to a spate of youth
violence, Attal also announced that he would seek to abolish age as a
mitigating circumstance for statutory penalties by default, meaning that
judges would charge lawbreaking children as adults unless they provided
explanations as to why an exception should be granted. At the same time, he
attacked the RN's programme of "division, hate, and stigmatisation," and said
the RN's backtracking on various economic policies showed that they were "not
ready to govern."[103] Macron likewise castigated the "uninhibited racism or
anti-Semitism" of the campaign in response to RN deputy Roger Chudeau saying
that his fellow former cabinet member Najat Vallaud-Belkacem should not have
been able to serve because of her dual nationality.[104]

Trailing in third place nationally behind the NFP and RN in pre-election
polls, Macron and his allies decided to focus their attacks on the programme
of the New Popular Front prior to the first round and mostly avoid direct
confrontation against the RN until the second round.[105] Attal claimed that
the NFP's proposal to raise the minimum wage by 14.3% to net €1,600 per month
would lead to the loss of 500,000 jobs, and Minister of Finance Bruno Le Maire
claimed that it would be "a catastrophe" resulting in "mass unemployment" if
implemented, with the European Commission having just announced it would meet
to launch the excessive deficit procedure against France.[106] Macron publicly
denounced the NFP's "totally immigrationist" stance and decried proposals
which would make it easier for transgender people to change their civil status
by allowing them to do so at their local town hall as "completely
grotesque,"[107] and his former prime minister Élisabeth Borne decried the
alliance as being one of "separatist wokists who support Islamism and
communitarianism" with a nonsensical programme and disastrous economic
policies.[108]

A recurring theme of the Ensemble campaign was the willingness of its
figureheads to draw equivalencies between the New Popular Front and National
Rally. On 21 June, Macron argued that, "contrary to what some say," the left
and RN are not "rampart[s] of [each] other ... there are extremes we must not
allow to pass."[109] Finance minister Bruno Le Maire warned that a victory by
either the far-right or the left could cause a financial crisis,[110]
lambasting both of their economic platforms as "leftist projects inspired by
Marxism."[111] In an interview on 24 June, Gender Equality Minister Aurore
Bergé remarked that "the best rampart, particularly against the Popular Front,
is not the RN, it's us," and like Macron, refused to give second-round voting
instructions in support of either of "the extremes" represented by the New
Popular Front and RN prior to the first round.[112] In a podcast episode
released the same day, Macron warned that the "two extremes" would lead France
"to civil war," whether because of the xenophobia of the RN or the
communitarianism of the left.[113]

Many of Macron's closest advisors publicly expressed dismay at his decision to
dissolve the National Assembly in the days after his surprise announcement.
Yaël Braun-Pivet, president of the National Assembly before the dissolution,
privately disagreed with the decision and attempted to dissuade him, and said
she believed that a coalition was possible. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire
trashed Macron's coterie at the Élysée as "woodlice," and his former prime
minister Édouard Philippe, head of the Horizons party within the Ensemble
alliance, said that Macron had "killed the presidential majority" through his
reckless decision.[114] Outgoing Ensemble deputies expressed exasperation with
Macron, with one remarking that "I wish he'd shut up and let us get out of the
mess he's gotten us into;" François Bayrou, leader of alliance member MoDem,
deemed it necessary to "de-Macronise the campaign;"[115] and candidates became
"fed up" with Macron's refusal to abide by his promise to stay out of the
campaign.[116]

As Macron's popularity ratings plunged to their lowest level ever in post-
dissolution surveys, with Frédéric Dabi [fr] noting that most respondents in
an Ifop-JDD survey characterised the decision as "incomprehensible,"
"thoughtless," or "irresponsible" and 70% in a BVA Xsight-RTL survey declaring
that they did not want Macron involved in the campaign,[117][118][119]
Ensemble candidates kept a local focus, with images of Macron were almost
entirely absent from campaign posters: only one out of 22 government
ministers' posters featured his image.[120] Along with Philippe, Le Maire, and
Minister of the Interior Gérald Darmanin (who announced that he would leave
the government if re-elected to the National Assembly),[121] many of Macron's
early supporters distanced themselves from him,[122] and he faced increasing
rejection among former allies frustrated with his antics and public
statements.[123]

#### The Republicans

[edit]

Ciotti in 2023

Main articles: 2024 The Republicans crisis and Union of the Far-Right

The president of The Republicans (LR), Éric Ciotti, spoke in favour of an
alliance with the National Rally RN during an 11 June interview with the
French channel TF1. Olivier Marleix, the head of the party in the National
Assembly, called for Ciotti's resignation in response.[124] On 12 June, The
Republicans' political committee voted unanimously to remove Ciotti as its
president and expel him from the party. However, the latter rejected the
decision, calling it "a flagrant violation of our statutes" that was illegal
and void.[125] A Paris court reviewed the decision on 14 June, in which Ciotti
was reinstated as party leader in the interim, as well as a member of the
party,[126] which was followed by two additional abortive attempts to remove
him,[127] while the local branch of The Republicans in Hauts-de-Seine
announced a local alliance with Renaissance.[110] On 17 June, Ciotti secured
an agreement with RN to present 62 candidates (later 63), none of which are
outgoing LR deputies except for himself and his close ally Christelle
d'Intorni, while the national investiture committee of LR unveiled candidates
in a majority of other constituencies, including all other incumbent deputies
seeking re-election, as well as fielding candidates against both Ciotti and
d'Intorni.[73][71][1] Because Ciotti requested that the party's bank require
his authorisation for any transactions, LR candidates are not receiving any
financial support from the party.[128]

With no detailed national election programme to run on, most LR candidates
opted to campaign primarily on issues concerning their constituencies, rely on
their strong local roots and name recognition in order to fight for their
survival, and keep their distance from the drama surrounding the other three
main political forces and Ciotti's alliance with the RN. Numerous incumbent LR
deputies declined to feature the party's logo on their election paraphernalia,
stayed out of national media, and tried to portray themselves as independent
of any party, with Aurélien Pradié choosing to describe himself on leaflets as
"a strong voice, a free voice,"[129] before announcing that he would run only
under the label of his micro-party _Du courage_ on 26 June, declaring in an
interview with _La Dépêche_ that "Gaullism isn't dead, it's more alive than
ever, but LR is dead."[130] This reduced visibility was also the product of
the highly varied circumstances of LR candidates, with 63 invested as part of
the LR-RN alliance, roughly 400 invested by the party's national investiture
committee, and 39 other candidates (including 26 incumbents) completely
unopposed by the Ensemble coalition owing to their "constructive" alignment
with Macron's policies. Even figures with a significant national profile like
former party president Laurent Wauquiez, threatened by the possibility of an
RN wave, sought to stay out of the national spotlight and focused on avoiding
being subsumed by the tripolarisation of the electorate.[129][1]

#### National Rally

[edit]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Jordan_Bardella_%28cropped%29.jpg/170px-
Jordan_Bardella_%28cropped%29.jpg)Jordan Bardella in 2022

Eight of the 30 National Rally (RN) MEPs newly elected to the European
Parliament in June 2024 decided to run in the national election. As occupying
both posts is impossible, MEPs who won in the legislative elections were
replaced with other party members further down the list.[131]

Marine Le Pen promised that the RN would form a "national unity government"
should it win the election,[132] and in an interview with _La Voix du Nord_ ,
she indicated she was open to the possibility of appointments for figures from
the left in an RN-led government.[133] At the same time, party leader Jordan
Bardella said that he was "the only one capable of blocking Jean-Luc Mélenchon
and blocking the far left" and urged "all the patriotic forces of the
republic" to unite and prevent the left from winning the election. He also
pledged to pass an immigration law allowing the deportation of "delinquents
and Islamists" and cut energy costs as prime minister.[110] In an interview
with _Le Monde_ , Le Pen confirmed that Bardella would not seek the post of
prime minister in the absence of an absolute majority.[134]

On 18 June, Bardella urged voters to give his party an "absolute majority" for
it to be able to govern effectively, while pledging to cut energy taxes to
5.5% from 20%.[135] Bardella pledged to uphold French military commitments to
NATO and support Ukraine against the Russian invasion, but ruled out sending
long-range missiles and other weapons that could be used to strike Russian
territory.[136] Alluding to the possibility of Emmanuel Macron sending ground
forces to Ukraine, Le Pen deemed Macron's title of "commander-in-chief of the
armed forces" as "honorary" given the need for both the heads and state and
government to make most defence decisions, though constitutional law experts
noted that the president's approval was still required for the usage of
nuclear weapons.[137]

Due to worries about public backlash and concerns from investors, the RN
softened and postponed some elements of its initial economic proposals,
including the planned tax exemptions on those under 30 and abolition of the
value-added tax (VAT) on 100 essential products,[138] and proposals to
increase teachers' salaries were also deferred. Despite initial claims
otherwise, Bardella reaffirmed on 17 June that the RN intended to repeal the
2023 pension reform and reduce the legal retirement age to 60, but only for
those who started working before the age of 20.[139] In an interview with _Le
Journal du Dimanche_ published on 22 June, Bardella announced that, as prime
minister, he would initiate a national budgetary audit and call a
constitutional referendum to guarantee reductions in migratory flows in 2027.
He also stated that he did not support Frexit and assured that, after their
alliance, members of The Republicans (LR) supported jointly by Éric Ciotti and
the RN would be included in his government.[140]

Bardella officially unveiled the RN's programme on 24 June, including measures
to introduce mandatory sentencing, end child benefits for parents of underage
repeat offenders, and sentence youth criminals to short prison sentences at
closed educational centres for children. He confirmed that the RN continued to
intend to abolish _jus soli_ because "the automatic acquisition of French
nationality is no longer justified in a world of 8 billion people, [with] our
daily struggles of our inability to integrate and assimilate them multiplying
on our soil," and expressed his desire to both "re-establish the offence of
illegal stays" and solidify these proposals in the constitution "to also make
them untouchable by European or international jurisprudence" through a
national referendum. In addition, he declared that he would scrutinise
"spending that encourages immigration" and "certain expensive and abusive tax
loopholes," and that the reversal of Macron's pension reform would be
implemented gradually, shifting the legal retirement age to 62 for those who
have worked for at least 40 years.[141] The party is against measures to
tackle climate change and protecting the environment.[142]

Other RN proposals included seeking to provide incentives for medical
professionals to work in underserved areas and for retirees to return to
work,[141] reducing taxes on agriculture, privatising French national media,
boosting fertility rates by allowing parents to claim their first two children
as a full share rather than the current half-share for the purposes of
personal income tax calculations, eliminating inheritance taxes for lower-
income families, continuing to not recognise Palestine as a state as doing so
would, in his view, be "to recognise terrorism,"[143] imposing moratoriums on
new wind farms and the closure of healthcare facilities, banning agricultural
products which fall below standards for domestic products, and ensuring that
only French nationals be eligible for some security and defence jobs, after an
earlier announcement that Dual nationals would be banned from such "sensitive"
jobs as those.[144] After outcry following RN deputy Roger Chudeau's comments
that dual nationals (specifically Najat Vallaud-Belkacem) should not hold
ministerial posts, Le Pen disavowed the idea that of restricting ministerial
posts on basis of dual nationality and added that Chudeau's comments were
contrary to the RN's programme.[145]

#### Other political parties

Marion Maréchal, a far-right candidate for Reconquête in the preceding
European Parliament election, met with her aunt Marine Le Pen and Jordan
Bardella, leaders of the National Rally (RN), on 10 June in order to discuss a
potential far-right alliance during the legislative election.[146] After the
meeting, Maréchal indicated that Bardella was opposed to an alliance with
Reconquête as his party did not want to be affiliated with Reconquête party
leader Éric Zemmour;[147] regardless, she announced her endorsement of the RN.
On 12 June, Zemmour announced that he was expelling Maréchal from the
party.[148] The party ultimately presented candidates in 330 constituencies,
deciding not to run candidates in constituencies where ideologically similar
candidates had the strongest chance of winning.[75]

Debout la France only contested 107 constituencies, backing candidates
supported by the RN elsewhere, and party leader Nicolas Dupont-Aignan
expressed his support for the alliance between Éric Ciotti and the RN.[69][70]

Trotskyist party Lutte Ouvrière presented candidates in 550 constituencies.
Other parties presenting a double-digit number of candidates, according to a
_Le Monde_ analysis, include the New Anticapitalist Party with 30 candidates,
Ecology at the Centre with 23 candidates, Unser Land with 14 candidates, and
Résistons! with 12 candidates.[1] The Animalist Party, which was able to field
candidates in 421 constituencies in 2022, announced that it would not attempt
to field candidates with such short notice before the first round of the 2024
legislative election.[43]

### Debates

[edit]

France 3 and France Bleu announced they would organise more than 200 debates
between local candidates which would be broadcast on local television and
radio with the first set held on 19 June, followed by additional debates on 26
June and 3 July.[149] Between the two rounds, 23 RN candidates refused to
participate or cancelled their appearances in these debates.[150]

TF1 also announced plans to hold a debate on 25 June between Gabriel Attal,
Jordan Bardella, and Manuel Bompard.[151] On 22 June, Attal, taking note of
three-time presidential candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon's comments refusing to
rule out the possibility that he might seek to become prime minister,
challenged him to participate in the debate instead of Bompard, the national
operations team coordinator of La France Insoumise,[152] a demand also echoed
by Bardella, though Mélenchon declined.[153] The Republicans appealed their
exclusion from the TF1 debate to the _Conseil d'État_ , with the Regulatory
Authority for Audiovisual and Digital Communication already having declined to
take action,[154] though this appeal was rejected the next day, a few hours
before the debate.[155]

France 2 also held a debate on 27 June between Attal, Bardella, and Olivier
Faure,[156] during which Attal directed viewers to a calculator for retirement
pensions under the New Popular Front's plans, leading the alliance to initiate
emergency proceedings against Renaissance for "false and misleading
allegations likely to alter the vote" under article L163-2 of the electoral
code, with hearings set for 1 July.[157]

Several debates were also initially anticipated between the two rounds,
including one hosted by France 2 on 4 July. For the other two debates between
the two rounds, the New Popular Front chose to send Marine Tondelier on BFM TV
and Ian Brossat on CNews, respecting the boycott of the channel by The
Ecologists and the Socialist Party.[156][158] On 1 July, Bardella challenged
Mélenchon to a one-on-one debate, which the latter declined, and Tondelier
confirmed her participation in the third debate,[159] before BFM TV announced
on 2 July that no debate would be held, and the three invitees would instead
each be allocated a one-hour segment in a different viewing format.[150] Later
reporting indicated that this decision was motivated by the fact that The
Ecologists were allocated a smaller share of constituencies in the agreement
of the New Popular Front, but Marc-Olivier Fogiel publicly insisted that it
was the RN's stance that forced BFM TV to call off the debate.[160]
Ultimately, it was announced that none of these broadcasts would be held in a
debate format.[161]

The campaign was marred by numerous incidents of racial and anti-Semitic
abuse. On 17 June, Hanane Mansouri, The Republicans (LR) member supported by
the National Rally (RN) for Isère's 8th constituency, revealed that she was
inundated by anti-Arab racist abuse after her candidacy was confirmed.[162] La
France Insoumise (LFI) candidate Yasmina Samri, running in Charente-Maritime's
1st constituency, decided to end her candidacy after receiving numerous racist
insults and threats.[163] While campaigning in Marseille for the New Popular
Front on 20 June, Raphaël Glucksmann, accompanied by journalist Léa Salamé,
was recorded being told "shame on you as a Jew" by a voter after trying to
give them a leaflet. He subsequently revealed that his cell phone number had
been leaked on Telegram groups and he was now simultaneously being bombarded
with hateful messages from members of the Jewish far-right – outraged at his
involvement in the alliance – and those on the left who alleged he was a pro-
Netanyahu Zionist on the basis of his Ashkenazic surname.[164]

On 24 June, Shannon Seban, Renaissance candidate for Val-de-Marne's 10th
constituency, announced that she filed a police complaint in response to a
group of pro-Palestine festivalgoers screaming "get out, dirty Zionist" at
her.[165] In Calvados, the campaign posters of LFI MEP-elect Emma Fourreau and
6th constituency candidate Noé Gauchard were defaced with swastikas and neo-
Nazi symbols,[166] as were those for The Ecologists (LE) candidate Guillaume
Hédouin in Manche's 1st constituency along with the word "Islam,"[167] while
those for Pascaline Lécorché of Place Publique in Bouches-du-Rhône's 1st
constituency were covered with "Hamas candidates" stickers.[168] On the day of
the first round, Roxane Lundy, candidate for Génération.s in Oise's 1st
constituency, discovered that her campaign posters in Beauvais and Maignelay-
Montigny had been defaced with swastikas.[169]

##### By candidates

[edit]

On 17 June, _Libération_ reported that Marie-Christine Sorin, RN candidate for
Hautes-Pyrénées's 1st constituency, made a tweet in January saying "No, not
all civilizations are equal ... [some] have just stayed below bestiality in
the evolutionary chain."[170] The RN initially suspended their support for
Joseph Martin, candidate for Morbihan's 1st constituency, after the discovery
of a 2018 tweet reading "Gas brought justice to the victims of the
Holocaust,"[171] but reinstated him after he explained that he meant it as an
allusion to the death of Holocaust denier Robert Faurisson the day prior.[172]
On 19 June, the pro-Éric Ciotti faction of LR withdrew their support for
Louis-Joseph Pecher, jointly supported by the RN in Meurthe-et-Moselle's 5th
constituency, due to his history of "anti-Semitic, homophobic and odious
remarks."[173] Another pro-Ciotti LR candidate supported by the RN, Gilles
Bourdouleix, was previously convicted for condoning crimes against humanity in
2014 for saying that "Hitler didn't kill enough" Romani people, though his
sentence was suspended on the basis that he never intended for his remarks to
be made public.[174] On 25 June, Pascal Schneider, mayor of Neuves-Maisons,
filed a complaint with the public prosecutor against Pierre-Nicolas Nups,
candidate of the Party of France in Meurthe-et-Moselle's 5th constituency, for
electoral posters featuring a young white boy with blue eyes and blond hair
reading "Let's give white children a future."[175]

On 26 June, Reconquête leader Éric Zemmour shared a video of him tapping along
to the rhythm of the TikTok-viral song "Je partira pas" ("I willn't [sic]
leave"), which features various overtly xenophobic lyrics, with audio of the
song – remixing the screams of a man being apprehended by the police while
being carried off a plane in a viral video – in the background. While the
song, supposedly created with AI by an artist under the name "Crazy-Girl," was
removed for violating TikTok's content guidelines, it spread widely over
social media, and was denounced by French Communist Party leader Fabien
Roussel.[176] SOS Racisme announced that it filed a complaint with the
authorities regarding the song for incitement of hatred.[177] The RN also
denounced the "calls for murder, violent misogyny, crude anti-Semitism and
conspiracism" of the lyrics of "No Pasarán" which was released by a collective
of rappers opposed to the far-right after the first round.[150]

Thierry Dussud of the RN, substitute for the Ciotti-aligned LR candidate
supported by the RN in Ardèche's 2nd constituency, Vincent Trébuchet,
announced on 26 June that he would quit after racist and anti-Semitic posts he
made resurfaced, including one in which he declared "Let's give the Africans
back to Africa."[178] In addition to the 20 RN candidates identified by
_Libération_ as having made racist, anti-Semitic, and discriminatory comments
on social media, _Mediapart_ also uncovered similar posts by another 24 RN
candidates using their real names.[179] On 27 June, LFI withdrew its support
for Reda Belkadi, candidate for Loir-et-Cher's 1st constituency, after the
discovery of his past anti-Semitic and homophobic tweets including anti-Jewish
and anti-gay slurs.[180]

On 1 July, Paule Veyre de Soras, RN candidate for Mayenne's 1st constituency,
apologised for her comments that "my ophthalmologist is a Jew, and my dentist
is a Muslim" in response to a journalist's question about racism within her
party.[181] On 2 July, Ludivine Daoudi, RN candidate for Calvados's 1st
constituency, withdrew after her NFP opponent circulated images of her wearing
a Luftwaffe visor cap with a swastika on it.[182] That same day, Daniel
Grenon, incumbent RN deputy for Yonne's 1st constituency, was referred to the
public prosecutor for saying during a debate that "North Africans came to
power in 2016 ... [they] have no place in high places."[183]

After regional daily _La Montagne_ uncovered racist social media posts by
Isabelle Dupré, RN candidate for Puy-de-Dôme's 2nd constituency, she responded
"If I'm elected, I'll stop the racist humor." Reporting also uncovered photos
in which Julie Apricena, substitute to Pierre Gentillet, RN candidate for
Cher's 3rd constituency, was accompanied by neo-Nazi skinheads and wearing a
T-shirt reading "White Pride, World Wide."[150] On 3 July, Jean-Yves Le
Boulanger, RN candidate for Côtes-d'Armor's 5th constituency, denied that he
was a "fascist" because he has "friends of colour" and didn't use his
motorcycle to run over "a coloured priest who blessed" him.[184] The same day,
Laurent Gnaedig, RN candidate for Haut-Rhin's 1st constituency, said that he
believed Jean-Marie Le Pen's comments that gas chambers were a mere "detail"
of World War II were not anti-Semitic, and added that he had "doubts" about Le
Pen's conviction for dismissing crimes against humanity.[185] A civil servant
of Moroccan origin accused Philippe Torre, RN candidate for Aisne's 2nd
constituency, of making racist statements in an altercation on 3 July by
implying that he would be deported despite being a French national.[186]

#### Physical attacks involving candidates and activists

[edit]

Several candidates also reported attacks against them and activists supporting
them over the course of the campaign. Florian Chauche, LFI candidate and
incumbent deputy for Territoire de Belfort's 2nd constituency, decried
physical attacks and the usage of racist slurs against his supporters on 17
June.[187] On 20 June, Hervé Breuil, RN candidate for Loire's 2nd
constituency, alleged that a group of masked individuals struck him from
behind and pelted him with rotten fruit while hurling verbal abuse at
him.[188] On 23 June, numerous left-wing activists (for LE candidate Céline
Papin in Gironde's 1st constituency, LE candidate and outgoing deputy Sabrina
Sebaihi in Hauts-de-Seine's 4th constituency, and Socialist Party (PS)
candidate Joao Martins Pereira in Val-de-Marne's 8th constituency) reported
being assaulted and threatened by supporters of the far-right.[189]

Séverine Vézies, LFI candidate for Doubs's 1st constituency, claimed that a
self-proclaimed RN supporter attempted to strike a man in his 80s with a
broomstick while putting up a campaign poster for her on 25 June.[190]
Danielle Simonnet, LFI deputy for Paris's 15th constituency, organised a
"rally against the far-right" after four of her supporters were tear-gassed,
assaulted, and called "anti-Semitic bastards" by a group of far-right
supporters while putting up election posters in the 20th arrondissement of
Paris on the evening of 2 July.[191] On 3 July, RN MEP Marie Dauchy, candidate
for Savoie's 3rd constituency, announced she was suspending campaigning after
being attacked at the market in La Rochette, with a merchant allegedly trying
to kick her while tearing up her campaign leaflets.[192]

On the evening of 3 July, Prisca Thevenot, Spokesperson of the Government of
France and Renaissance candidate for Hauts-de-Seine's 8th constituency, along
with her substitute Virginie Lanlo [fr] and one of her supporters, were
attacked by a group of fifteen people while putting up campaign posters in
Meudon, with four of them arrested following the attack. The supporter in
question was struck in the face using a scooter, breaking their jaw, while
Lanlo was punched and kicked, while Thevenot herself escaped uninjured.[193]
Bernard Dupré, deputy mayor of La Tronche, was punched in the right eye by a
man who he says claimed to be an LFI supporter on 4 July while putting up
campaign posters for the campaign of Olivier Véran, Renaissance candidate for
Isère's 1st constituency,[194] though the attacker claimed that Dupré was the
first one to strike him.[195]

On 4 July, Thomas Mesnier, former Horizons deputy and candidate for Charente's
1st constituency, reported that one of his supporters had been kicked,
punched, and targeted by homophobic insults by a group of four people while
putting up posters in Angoulême.[196] That evening, Geoffroy Didier, LR
candidate for Hauts-de-Seine's 6th constituency, reported that one of his
supporters had been "violently assaulted and threatened with death" in
Neuilly-sur-Seine while leafleting for his campaign.[197] Three supporters of
Maxime Viancin, LFI candidate for Loire-Atlantique's 10th constituency, were
chased down the street by an RN supporter who screamed "Bardella will take
care of the lefties, dykes and trans" at them before pushing one and punching
another, while his wife joined him on the street while waving a French
flag.[198]

On 2 July, _Le Courrier de la Mayenne_ resurfaced a report from 12 January
1995 about Annie-Claire Jaccoud Bell, RN candidate for Mayenne's 3rd
constituency, engaging in an attempted armed hostage-taking at the Ernée town
hall, firing a single wayward shot from a rifle she smuggled into the town
hall while fighting with a secretary.[199]

In anticipation of potential violence after the second round, Minister of the
Interior Gérald Darmanin announced that 30,000 police would be deployed across
the country on the evening of 7 July.[193] He also announced on the morning of
5 July that despite the short campaign, 51 different candidates, substitutes,
and supporters had been physically attacked, often suffering significant
injuries requiring medical attention in the process, with more than 30 arrests
having been made among people with "extremely varied profiles."[195]

#### Death threats

[edit]

Many candidates also reported receiving death threats both online and in real
life. On 15 June, Jean-Jacques Gaultier, LR candidate for Vosges's 4th
constituency, reported receiving a death threat via post.[200] On 19 June,
Elsa Richard, LE candidate for Maine-et-Loire's 1st constituency, reported
messages from people threatening to behead her in front of her house to the
police.[201] On 21 June, Pierre Morel-À-L'Huissier, miscellaneous centre
candidate and outgoing deputy for Lozère's constituency, filed a police
complaint after discovering a large tag with a death threat against him in
Gorges du Tarn Causses.[202][1] After being targeted by extensive harassment
and numerous death threats on social media, Ethan Leys, RN candidate for
Nord's 8th constituency, filed a police complaint and suspended in-person
campaign activities.[203] While attending a France 3 Franche-Comté debate, a
supporter of Philippe Ghiles, Reconquête candidate for Haute-Saône's 1st
constituency, threatened to kill the debate host, prompting the latter to file
a complaint with the police.[204] Babette de Rozières, candidate jointly
supported by Ciotti and the RN in Yvelines's 7th constituency, asserted that
she was targeted with death threats and racist comments after her candidacy
was unveiled.[205] After a hundred lawyers signed on to an anti-RN letter in
_Marianne_ , the far-right website _Réseau libre_ published an article calling
for the murder of all of its signatories.[161]

In addition, Alice Cordier, head of the feminist and white identitarian group
Collectif Némésis, filed a complaint for death threats recorded on 16 October
2023 made against her by Raphaël Arnault, LFI candidate in Vaucluse's 1st
constituency and a spokesperson for the Jeune Garde Antifasciste with several
"S cards" (which have often been applied to individuals considered potential
threats to national security) to his name.[206]

## Results

[edit]

### National results

[edit]

Results listed below correspond to the groupings created by the Ministry of
the Interior, which may differ slightly from the figures reported in other
sources due to reclassification of candidates into different political parties
and alliances. Differences noted in the footnotes of the national results
table below reflect political parties and alliances attributed to candidates
by _Le Monde_. The Ministry of the Interior classifications generally include
fewer candidates within the groupings for Ensemble, the New Popular Front, and
The Republicans when compared with _Le Monde_ and other media outlets which
opt to not use the Ministry of the Interior's candidate classifications; as a
result, the official vote and seat totals listed below may be lower than the
ones reported in those sources.[1][2]

On the basis of the final results published by the Ministry of the Interior
and candidate classifications of _Le Monde_ , the New Popular Front obtained
182 seats, compared to Ensemble with 168, RN-supported candidates with 143,
and 45 for LR (compared with 56 claimed by the party, due to differences in
candidate self-identification). Out of those 182 NFP deputies, 74 are
attributed to LFI, 59 to the PS, 28 to LE, 9 to the PCF, 5 to Génération.s, 5
to miscellaneous left deputies, and 2 to regionalists. _Le Monde_ also tallied
102 Renaissance, 33 MoDem, 26 Horizons, 3 miscellaneous centre, and 2 UDI
deputies, as well as 1 deputy each under the labels of miscellaneous right and
Agir. The Ministry of the Interior does not classify candidates by party but
rather by "political nuances" as defined within the National Directory of
Elected Officials [fr], so no official breakdown of the results of NFP or
Ensemble candidates by self-declared party is available.[3][1][2] Although
nuances for several components of those alliances were provided in 2024,
neither are fully compatibilised with the actual or self-declared affiliation
of candidates within these alliances.[b][c]

Turnout in the first round of the legislative elections was exceptionally
high, including 2.7 million proxy voting requests, with pollsters estimating
the final turnout to be the highest for the first round of a legislative
election since 1997,[5] which was confirmed in the provisional results with
turnout at 66.71%. In the first round, the RN and their allies secured the
largest share of the vote in the first round with 33.21% of the vote, followed
by the parties of the New Popular Front with 28.21%,[b] those of Ensemble with
21.28%,[c] and LR candidates with 6.57%, with an overall turnout of 66.71%.[2]

On the basis of the first round results (not accounting for candidate
withdrawals after the first round), 306 constituencies were headed to three-
way runoffs and 5 to four-way runoffs,[6] with only 89 three-way and 2 four-
way runoffs remaining after candidate withdrawals announced ahead of the
registration deadline for the second round.[7] A total of 76 candidates were
directly elected in the first round,[2] and RN-supported candidates qualified
for the second round in 444 other constituencies, compared to 415 for the NFP,
321 for Ensemble, and 63 for LR (according to _Le Monde'_s classifications of
candidates by political affiliation).[233]

### Voting instructions and withdrawals

[edit]

#### Before the first round

[edit]

In an interview with Cyril Hanouna on Europe 1 on 24 June, Gender Equality
Minister Aurore Bergé, like Emmanuel Macron, declined to specify second-round
voting instructions between either the New Popular Front (NFP) and National
Rally (RN) while also implying that any such discussions would not take place
until after the first round.[234][112] Both of Renaissance's alliance
partners' leaders, François Bayrou of the Democratic Movement (MoDem) and
Édouard Philippe of Horizons, also refused to address the issue, with allies
of Macron reportedly divided on this question.[235]

On the afternoon of 25 June, Macron and the leaders of Renaissance, MoDem,
Horizons, the Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI), the Radical Party,
and several other members of his coterie met to discuss the matter, with a
general consensus emerging among participants to call to block the RN and La
France Insoumise (LFI) candidates in the second round and potentially withdraw
on a case-by-case basis, though no decision was reached by the end of the
meeting.[96] Interviewed on the evening of 26 June, Bayrou remarked, "we will
vote for neither a National Rally nor LFI candidate ... why have the political
forces, which I consider to be republicans, gone and settled themselves under
the yoke of a very radical, brutal, violent far-left?"[236] Philippe then
called on all third-placed Horizons candidates who advanced to give up their
candidacy in the second round.[8]

Marine Tondelier, leader of The Ecologists, announced in an interview the same
day that candidates from her party would withdraw if they were eligible to
advance to the second round but finished in third place,[237] a view also
shared by Raphaël Glucksmann of Place Publique.[238] LFI MEP Manon Aubry
stated that the decisions of LFI candidates in three-way races would be made
on a case-by-case basis.[239] Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure, along with
Glucksmann, Tondelier, and two government ministers (Clément Beaune and Agnès
Pannier-Runacher) signed onto an open letter published in _Le Monde_ on 25
June pushing for all parties facing to reach an agreement to withdraw
candidates in order to block the RN, though no LFI representatives signed onto
the letter.[240] On 26 June, Jean-Luc Mélenchon indicated that LFI would issue
voting instructions after the first round and told his supporters to not vote
for the RN.[93] In a press release on 27 June, the French Communist Party
(PCF) confirmed that it would instruct its voters to support a "republican
candidate" against the RN in the second round, and that its candidates would
withdraw if they advanced to the second round but finished third in the
first.[180]

While he was opposed to the prospect of an alliance between The Republicans
(LR) and the National Rally, LR vice president François-Xavier Bellamy
declared that he would support candidates of the RN against those of the NFP
in the second round, even in the case that they were not LFI candidates.[241]
In an interview on 26 June, Julien Aubert declared that he would vote for any
candidate against the RN in most cases, but would vote for them if faced with
a LFI candidate.[236]

In a press release after the first round, Ensemble announced that they would
call upon third-placed candidates to withdraw in constituencies where other
candidates "with shared values" were able to beat the RN, including the
possibility of desisting in favour of selected LFI candidates.[8] Bergé,
interviewed after the first round, reaffirmed that candidates would withdraw
to block the RN except in the case that it might help to elect an LFI deputy,
with other parties in the alliance sharing a similar line of case-by-case
withdrawals in runoffs with LFI candidates,[159] but Attal also emphasised
that withdrawals did not constitute endorsements and that the alliance would
not officially issue any voting instructions, even if individual candidates
did.[150]

A story published by _Le Monde_ on 5 July suggested that Attal spearheaded the
anti-RN blockade to Macron's chagrin, with the latter annoyed by Attal's
relative independence. Macron also called Ensemble candidates to pressure them
to not drop out up until the last moment, with his inner circle reportedly
becoming more comfortable with the idea of an RN victory even as Attal warned
about the dangers of the far-right coming to power.[242]

Mélenchon ultimately announced that all third-placed candidates of the New
Popular Front who advanced to the second round in constituencies where the RN
placed first would stand down.[8] In duels between left-of-centre candidates,
the PS called for voters to support the higher-placed candidate, as well as
for the withdrawal of lower-placed candidates,[150] a view also echoed by the
leadership of the French Communist Party.[243]

The Republicans ultimately chose not to give any voting instructions for the
second round.[8]

According to RN deputy Sébastien Chenu, a number of deputies, including those
belonging to Ensemble, reached out to ask third-placed RN candidates to
withdraw in order to block candidates of the left from winning in the second
round, a request which Chenu indicated the party's leadership would
consider.[159]

According to the classifications of _Le Monde_ , 89 three-way and 2 four-way
runoffs remained after the publicly announced withdrawals of 134 NFP-supported
and 82 Ensemble-supported candidates.[7] All but 5 NFP candidates withdrew in
races where they placed 3rd or below in the first round and RN-backed
candidates also qualified, compared to 15 Ensemble candidates (of which 9 were
in races where LFI qualified) and 12 The Republicans or miscellaneous right
candidates (of which 5 were in races where LFI qualified) in the same
situation.[2][7] Two candidates who also initially registered for the second
round – Dominique Despras in Rhône's 8th constituency and France Moreau in
Maine-et-Loire's 5th constituency – changed their mind after finding out about
other candidates' registrations in the second round. Because they were unable
to officially withdraw at this point, they declined to submit any of their
paper ballots, meaning that voters did not find paper ballots with the name of
either candidate at polling stations.[244]

### Second round

[edit]

Provisional results placed turnout in the second round at 66.63%, the highest
level since 1997.[245][2]

Contrary to pre-election projections, NFP-supported candidates won the largest
number of seats after the second round, with Ensemble candidates also beating
expectations by coming second ahead of RN-supported candidates in third,
trailed by LR candidates in fourth place. According to candidate labeling by
the Ministry of the Interior, candidates belonging to NFP parties received 180
seats (well short of the 289 needed for a majority),[b] compared to 159 for
those belonging to Ensemble parties,[c] 142 for RN-supported candidates, and
39 for LR candidates, resulting in no party controlling a parliamentary
majority. Unofficial media classifications of candidates' affiliations may
differ slightly from those used by the Ministry of Interior: according to _Le
Monde'_ s analysis, 182 NFP-affiliated candidates were elected, compared with
168 for Ensemble, 143 for the RN, and 45 for LR,[3][2] with 80 constituencies
shifting rightwards and 75 shifting leftwards.[246] The PS more than doubled
its number of elected deputies compared to 2022 and the RN gained the second-
most seats, while Renaissance suffered the most significant losses of any
individual party.[247][248]

An Ipsos survey suggested that the "republican front" against the RN remained
fairly strong in the second round, with first-round NFP voters supporting
Ensemble candidates over RN ones by a 72%–3% margin in second-round duels and
first-round Ensemble voters supporting PS/LE/PCF candidates over RN ones by a
54%–15% margin in second-round duels. NFP voters also backed LR candidates
over RN ones in second-round duels by a 70%–2% margin, and Ensemble voters by
a 79%–4% margin. Even in the case of LFI–RN duels, first-round Ensemble voters
supported LFI candidates over RN ones by a 43%–19% margin.[249]

The number of women elected to the National Assembly declined for the second
election in a row, from 215 in 2022 to 208 (36%), with the NFP having the
highest share at 41% followed by Ensemble with 39%, RN-supported deputies with
32%, and LR with 27%. The average age of the National Assembly remained
similar at 49 years and 2 months, with the RN having both the youngest
(Flavien Termet, 22) and oldest (José Gonzalez, 81) deputies. The average age
of the RN-supported and NFP deputies was 47, compared to 51 for Ensemble and
52 for LR. Out of the 577 elected deputies, 408 were re-elected, with the
highest rate of re-election for Ensemble and LR deputies (both roughly 84.5%)
followed by NFP (63%) and RN-supported (57%) deputies. The managerial and
professional class is overwhelmingly overrepresented among these 577 deputies,
accounting for more than 60% of all new elected officials, with this
percentage being similar among all four of the largest groupings. Only three
blue-collar workers were elected (0.5% of the National Assembly), compared to
their share of 19% in the overall population.[250]

For the first time in their history, the RN managed to elect candidates in
overseas constituencies:[251][252] Anchya Bamana, contesting in Mayotte's 2nd
constituency, and Joseph Rivière, running in Réunion's 3rd constituency, both
won a seat in the National Assembly.[251] The result in Mayotte was linked to
the political crisis affecting the region earlier in 2024.[252]

Emmanuel Tjibaou, the son of late Kanak independence leader Jean-Marie
Tjibaou, was elected to the National Assembly for New Caledonia's 2nd
constituency:[253][254] in the process, he became the first pro-independence
candidate to win a seat since 1986, and his victory was seen as a setback for
the French loyalist movement in New Caledonia, in the aftermath of the civil
unrest across the archipelago earlier in the year.[253] Peio Dufau became the
first left-wing _abertzale_ candidate to get elected to the National Assembly,
having run under the banner of Euskal Herria Bai (EH Bai), supported by the
NFP, in Pyrénées-Atlantiques's 6th constituency.[255]

## Aftermath

### Potential outcomes

de la République in Paris on 7 July

Although the president of France theoretically has the power to appoint any
individual as prime minister, the likelihood of a motion of no confidence
means that in practice, tradition dictates that the president must nominate
someone from any political bloc with an absolute majority of seats in the
incoming National Assembly, resulting in cohabitation in the event of an
opposition victory. When no political force obtains an absolute majority of
seats, any government will face the constant threat of a motion of no
confidence and handle legislation on a case-by-case basis unless a coalition
is secured to avoid this threat.[258]

Due to the tripolarisation of the electorate, unprecedented institutional
deadlock is a significant possibility if no bloc proves able to secure a
majority of votes in the National Assembly to insulate themselves from a
motion of no confidence. Snap elections can only be called at least a year
after the previous legislative election under the constitution.[258] Some
analysts also envisaged the possibility of an Italian-style technocratic
government or a 2020 Belgian-like temporary minority government of independent
figures prior to a second snap election.[259]

### Post-election manoeuvring

[edit]

Attal announced that he would resign as prime minister just after the results
were announced. Macron was not required to accept Attal's resignation, and the
latter noted that he would be willing to remain in his post as long as
necessary,[260] and Macron ultimately refused his resignation "for the time
being" on the morning of 8 July.[246] In a letter published in the regional
press on 10 July, Macron declared that "nobody won" the elections and added
that the current government would remain in place until it was clear that a
new "necessarily plural" government of "political forces that recognise
themselves in republican institutions" could be formed,[261] with leading
figures on the left decrying the letter as a "refus[al] to recognise the
result of the elections" showing that Macron was "in denial" and attempting a
"democratic coup" by signaling that he would not allow the NFP to lead the
next government if it included LFI members.[262] Macron accepted his
resignation on 16 July,[263] allowing ministers to vote for the president of
the National Assembly while remaining in place as a caretaker government.[264]

In an interview on 1 July, Aurore Bergé signaled openness to a coalition with
members of other parties, including "the Republicans who didn't want to
corrupt themselves with Éric Ciotti and with the RN, with certain members of
the Socialist Party, the ecologists, the communists,"[159] a view shared by
the leader of alliance partner Horizons Édouard Philippe.[265] Philippe called
for an "agreement which will stabilise the political situation" excluding LFI
and the RN. Séjourné likewise excluded the possibility of governing alongside
Mélenchon and some of his allies on the left, saying that there would be
certain prerequisites for any potential coalition.[3] Interviewed on 8 July,
Darmanin envisaged the possibility of cooperation with the PS on some issues
where they differed from LFI,[246] but went on to add that he was opposed to
working with ecologist deputies.[261] On 9 July, several Renaissance deputies
threatened to file a motion of no confidence in the event that the next
government included LFI deputies, and in the face of these threats and Attal's
continuation as prime minister, the NFP warned Macron "against any attempt to
hijack the institutions."[266]

A number of key figures indicated their preference for working with the right
rather than the left, with Philippe arguing for a "technical agreement" but
not coalition with LR in addition to Darmanin publicly stating that "the
country is on the right[, so] we must govern on the right," and Macron
reportedly met with LR Senate president Gérard Larcher on the evening of 8
July.[266][267] Bergé and Darmanin both publicly appealed for the support of
LR deputies the following day, with the latter also confirming that he would
also vote for a motion of no confidence against a NFP government, but Bayrou
was less receptive to the idea, suggesting that he preferred a coalition which
still involved some figures from the left.[261]

On 2 July, LFI national coordinator Manuel Bompard announced that his party
would not participate in a grand coalition including LFI and Ensemble,[265]
and Attal likewise ruled out the possibility of a coalition with LFI.[150]
Tondelier declined to rule out the possibility of participating in a coalition
but indicated her desire not to do so and her opposition to a Macron-aligned
prime minister.[268][269] Just after the second round, Mélenchon called for
the appointment of a prime minister from the left, echoed by Tondelier and
Faure, who said that the NFP intended to govern and would not support any
Ensemble-led coalition.[3] Yannick Jadot announced that the NFP would propose
its government the week of the second round, Faure declared that the alliance
would agree upon a name for prime minister by then, Bompard said that the NFP
would implement its programme in its entirety,[246] and Sandrine Rousseau
pledged not to repeatedly invoke article 49.3 unlike recent governments.[270]

PS alliance negotiator Johanna Rolland, along with Carole Delga, welcomed the
potential support of the leftmost Ensemble deputies in a NFP-led
coalition,[271][261] while Faure resisted pressure from Macron allies to break
away from LFI in order to form a government.[272] Huguette Bello emerged as a
possible name for prime minister on 12 July, proposed by Roussel but resisted
by the PS, which failed to approve Bello's candidacy on 13 July and called for
further discussions.[273] LFI reacted by suspending negotiations, demanding
that all parties agree upon on a single candidacy for the presidency of the
National Assembly, and refusing the possibility of a civil society figure
being appointed prime minister, after which the PS, LE, and PCF pushed for
discussions to resume and proposed appointing a civil society figure as prime
minister,[274] Laurence Tubiana,[275] a hypothesis publicly rejected by LFI
figureheads as too "Macron-compatible."[263] Tubiana dismissed the possibility
of becoming prime minister on 22 July.[276] On 23 July, the NFP announced that
it would propose 37-year-old civil servant Lucie Castets, director of finance
and purchasing for the city of Paris, for the post of prime minister, though
Macron will not appoint a new government until mid-August at earliest and
noted that the question was not of the name for prime minister but rather the
ability to find a majority to govern.[277]

Laurent Wauquiez ruled out the possibility of LR participating in a potential
coalition just after the results were announced.[3] President of the LR group
in the Senate Bruno Retailleau ruled out the possibility of working with any
coalition of the left, and like others within his party, deemed the LR brand
to be "dead."[246] Despite these statements, some LR figures still called for
a pro-Macron alliance in the National Assembly, including Xavier Bertrand and
Olivier Marleix.[266] After being elected president of the group, Wauquiez
proclaimed that he would not agree to a coalition but would be open to a
"legislative pact," and also signaled that the right would vote for a motion
of no confidence if any future government included LFI members,[261] a
position also held by Larcher.[278]

After falling short of pre-election expectations, Le Pen said that the RN's
victory "is only postponed" and that she could not be disappointed with the
party's gains in the election.[3] On 8 July, Sébastien Chenu appeared to
express regret about the controversies surrounding many of the candidates who
went on to lose their races, and affirmed that the RN would remain in
opposition "without compromise,"[246] and Zoltán Kovács announced that
Bardella would chair the Patriots for Europe group in the European
Parliament.[279] Gilles Pennelle, the general director of the party who
oversaw the selection of RN candidates, resigned the day after the
election.[246] On 11 July, Renaud Labaye initially announced that the RN would
not automatically vote for a motion of no confidence in a NFP-led government
including LFI members, but rather consider legislative texts on a case-by-case
basis,[280] but Le Pen subsequently clarified that the RN would do so in the
case that any government contained LFI or LE ministers, regardless of who led
it,[278] and Bardella confirmed that they would immediately vote for a motion
of no confidence in any NFP minority government.[281]

### Prime Ministerial appointment

[edit]

#### Appointment background

[edit]

After the dissolution of the 16th legislature by Macron on 9 June 2024, the
early legislative elections took place on 30 June and 7 July. While the
National Rally was originally anticipated to obtain a relative majority, it
came third behind the New Popular Front and Ensemble.

Then-Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, having only served six months in office,
presented his resignation to Macron, who accepted it on 16 July. The day
before the opening of the Paris Olympic Games, the New Popular Front proposed
that Lucie Castets be nominated as prime minister. In reaction, arguing that
"no one won [the elections]", Macron announced the holding of consultations to
form a government.[282]

On 16 August, at the end of the Olympic Games, Macron invited party leaders
and presidents of parliamentary groups from both chambers to the Palais de
l'Élysée on 23 August to try to form a government.[283] After the President
received the party leaders and the presidents of parliamentary groups,
Macron's office announced in a press release on 26 August that Castets would
not be appointed prime minister.[284]

On 2 September, Emmanuel Macron received nominations from Bernard Cazeneuve,
the former Socialist Party Prime Minister from 2016 to 2017, and Xavier
Bertrand, a former Hauts-de-France region president.[285] Faced with the risk
of a motion of censure, the candidacy of Michel Barnier was considered on 4
September.[286]

#### Final appointment

[edit]

Main article: Barnier government

On 5 September 2024, Michel Barnier was appointed as prime minister by Macron,
heading a Parliament divided nearly evenly between the leftist New Popular
Front, which holds the plurality of seats, Macron's centrist to centre-right
Ensemble, and the far-right National Rally.[287][288]

While the NFP has announced it would move a motion of no confidence against
any government not led by them, the National Rally announces that it will wait
for the general policy statement of the new government before deciding whether
to support any motions of no confidence or censure.[289]

### Composition of the National Assembly

[edit]

Plans for governance were likely to only be solidified after the formation of
parliamentary groups in the 17th legislature of the French Fifth Republic
clarified the alignment of elected deputies starting on 11 July, which was be
followed by the election of the next president of the National Assembly of
France on 18 July as well as the appointment of vice presidents, quaestors,
and secretaries as part of the bureau of the National Assembly of France
[fr].[290] Macron is expected to allow the bloc which is able to elect the
next president of the National Assembly to form the next government.[291]
Numerous figures on the left also called upon deputies to block the RN from
obtaining key posts in the National Assembly,[261] with pro-Macron deputies
potentially also willing to do so.[292] Renaissance deputy Yaël Braun-Pivet
was re-elected president of the National Assembly with 220 votes in the third
round of voting on 18 July owing to the support of LR deputies, ahead of NFP-
supported PCF deputy André Chassaigne with 207.[264] Across 19 and 20 July,
the NFP obtained 12 of 22 posts in the bureau of the National Assembly, with
the RN shut out of all posts.[293]

Shortly after the elections, Clémentine Autain, like Ruffin, announced that
she would not join the La France Insoumise group in the incoming legislature,
instead hoping to form a new group,[246] potentially alongside Christophe Bex
and LFI incumbents who managed to win re-election against official LFI
candidates including Alexis Corbière, Hendrik Davi, and Danielle
Simonnet,[294] with the five of them seeking to form a new group with members
of the PCF, LE, and Génération.s and Corbière also expressing his willingness
to join a unified NFP group,[266] and all but Ruffin announcing the creation
of the political movement L'Après on 12 July.[295] The five deputies
ultimately announced that they would join the Ecologist group on 15 July.[274]

The Democratic and Republican Left group appeared on course to meet the
threshold for 15 deputies in the new National Assembly, with Chassaigne
counting 8 PCF deputies, 1 Republican and Socialist Left (GRS) deputy, and "8
or 9" deputies from overseas France.[266]

Of the 22 deputies in the Liberties, Independents, Overseas and Territories
(LIOT) group before the snap election was called, 14 were re-elected. Because
the group is so close to the threshold of 15 deputies needed, negotiations are
likely to make the continuation of the group possible in the new National
Assembly.[296] However, Martine Froger and David Taupiac, re-elected with the
support of the NFP, declined to comment on the subject, as was the case with
Paul Molac, Jean-Luc Warsmann, and Estelle Youssouffa, while Yannick Favennec-
Bécot was noncommittal. Michel Castellani, Paul-André Colombani, Charles de
Courson, Stéphane Lenormand, Max Mathiasin, Christophe Naegelen, and Olivier
Serva are all committed to re-forming the group, while Valérie Létard
expressed her desire to assert her "independence" as her predecessor Béatrice
Descamps did in the LIOT group.[297] Lenormand was elected president of the
group of exactly 15 deputies on 16 July.[263]

The Elysée stated that Macron would wait for the new National Assembly to
organise itself before making "the necessary decisions."[246] On 12 July,
Attal announced that he would be a candidate for the presidency of the
Renaissance group and that it would be renamed to the "Together for the
Republic group" (_groupe Ensemble pour la République_) as well,[298] and was
elected on 13 July.[273]

Renaissance deputy Sacha Houlié, representing the left flank of his party,
pleaded with his colleagues to form a new "social democratic" group in the
National Assembly,[299] and was able to quickly gather 20 deputies for his
initiative. With many elected deputies embittered with Macron, only 33
deputies committed to joining the Renaissance group, with others preferring to
maintain their leverage and threatening to leave for Houlié's group or join
the MoDem in the event of an alliance with the right,[300] and Houlié
officially announced on 10 July that he would not join the Renaissance group,
which 40 deputies elected under the banner of Renaissance had yet to join, and
instead form his own "ranging from the social right to the socialist left,"
saying that he didn't "agree with [the pro-Macron line] anymore," adding that
he felt closest to the views of Glucksmann.[261] His efforts were ultimately
unsuccessful, with 97 of 98 Renaissance deputies joining the group.[273]

The Horizons group will be re-constituted in the new National Assembly,[300]
as will the MoDem group to be headed by Marc Fesneau after being elected
president on 10 July against Nicolas Turquois and previous group president
Jean-Paul Mattei, having already led the group between June 2017 and November
2018. However, as a minister in the current government, he must choose to
resign from either the government or as deputy.[301]

On 9 July, Aurélien Pradié stated that he believed there would no longer be a
LR group within the National Assembly, expecting a change in both their name
and way of operation.[266] On 10 July, Wauquiez, elected as leader of the
group upon his return to the National Assembly, announced that the group would
change its name to become "The Republican Right" (_La Droite
Républicaine_).[261]

Éric Ciotti announced the creation of a new group in the National Assembly
called On the Right! (_À droite !_), with 15 of 17 LR deputies elected with
the support of the RN appearing in a photo posted on social media.[266]

Bardella also implied that deputies elected with the support of the RN who
were implicated in various controversies during the campaign would not sit
with the National Rally group in the legislature.[246]

The Ministry of Interior did not report fully disaggregated results by alliance member, with the latter 4 codes only assigned to 11 candidates in total, largely running in either Corsica or overseas France, of which 7 are categorised by _Le Monde_ as candidates of the New Popular Front. Because the official candidate classifications of the Ministry of Interior and unofficial classifications of _Le Monde_ and other sources may differ due to media organisations creating their own candidate classifications, the vote and seat totals reported here may differ from those in other sources. According to _Le Monde'_ s analysis, 182 NFP-affiliated candidates were elected. The seat total here reflects the inclusion of two candidates elected under the SOC code associated with the PS, but is not inclusive of the generic ECO code attributed to miscellaneous ecologist candidates including Delphine Batho who was officially supported by the NFP, and both this tally and those compiled by other sources may not fully account for all regionalist (REG) or miscellaneous left (DVG) candidates who claim to have the NFP's support, particularly those in overseas France.[1][2][3]

The Ministry of Interior did not report fully disaggregated results by alliance member, and the codes REN and MDM are not applied to any candidates. Because the official candidate classifications of the Ministry of Interior and unofficial classifications of _Le Monde_ and other sources may differ due to media organisations creating their own candidate classifications, the vote and seat totals reported here may differ from those in other sources.[1][2] According to _Le Monde'_ s analysis, 168 Ensemble-affiliated candidates were elected.[3]
  4. **^** A Member of the European Parliament.
  5. **^** Includes elected candidates jointly invested by the Ciotti-led faction of the LR and backed by the RN (Union of the Far-Right, UXD), which won 17 out of total 142 seats won by RN-led alliance. One other candidate (Eddy Casterman, officially assigned to the miscellaneous far-right code EXD) was elected with the support of the RN but is neither a member of the party nor classified by the Ministry of the Interior as an RN candidate, for a total of 143 reported in some media sources.[1][2]

  7. **^** Elected candidates presented by the national investiture commission of The Republicans (French: _Commission nationale d'investiture des Républicains_) only; this figure is disputed in some sources due to the classification of numerous candidates who have distanced themselves from LR as miscellaneous right even if they are still members of the party.
