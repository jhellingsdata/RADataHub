## Background

[edit]

The elections were delayed by 12 months in February 2023.[3][4] The election
will be overseen by the Electoral Commission of Jamaica.[5]

In December 2023, a poll suggested that 38% of Jamaicans intended to
participate.[6]

## Results

[edit]

The Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) which won 7 of the 13 municipal corporations
won the elections despite losing the popular vote. The Citizens Action for
Free and Fair Elections (CAFFE) reported that the local elections proceeded
with no major incident.[7] There were 365 polling stations.[8]
