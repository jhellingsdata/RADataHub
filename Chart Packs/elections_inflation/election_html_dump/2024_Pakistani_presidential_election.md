Indirect Presidential elections were held in Pakistan on 9 March 2024 to
select the 14th President of Pakistan, who is the country's head of state.
Asif Ali Zardari of the PPP was elected as President, defeating Mahmood Khan
Achakzai of the PTI-backed alliance[2] Outgoing President Arif Alvi was
eligible for re-election but did not contest for a second term.[3]

## Background

[edit]

Main article: 2024 Pakistani general election

Since the National Assembly and the four Provincial Assemblies were dissolved
before the presidential election could take place, the election was conducted
after general elections to all five assemblies, which were held on 8 February
2024.[4] Therefore, the presidential election was held on 9 March 2024, as it
needed to be held within thirty days of the elections to the assemblies,
according to the proviso of Article 41(5) of the Constitution of Pakistan.
Moreover, according to the proviso of Article 44(1) of the Constitution of
Pakistan, Alvi continued to hold office until his successor would be
elected.[_citation needed_]

## Campaign

[edit]

Asif Ali Zardari had previously served as president from 2008 to 2013 and his
Pakistan People's Party (PPP) was aligned with the Pakistan Democratic
Movement (PDM) alliance.[5] The centre-left PPP had achieved a majority of
votes in Sindh and Balochistan, but this was not enough to gain the
presidency.[6] Zardari was only able to gain a majority of votes in parliament
and Punjab because of the support given by the PPP's partners in the PDM
alliance and in the coalition government formed after the 2024 general
election, including the PML-N, MQM-P, PML-Q, IPP, NP, and BAP.[2] These
parties, mainly the PML-N, held a majority of seats in the national and
provincial assemblies, although these national assembly seats were contested
for rigging.[7][8][9]

Mahmood Khan Achakzai’s campaign was heavily reliant on the Pashtunkhwa Milli
Awami Party (PMAP)’s alliance partners, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)
seat holders registered under the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC). Achakzai was a
regionalist from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,[10] but won votes nationwide due to
PTI-(SIC). Achakzai was supposedly nominated for the presidency by the PTI
after he held a popular speech in the National Assembly, demanding that the
constitution be respected, parliament be empowered and more importantly to
remove the military establishment from Pakistani politics, which was supported
by the PTI-(SIC).[11]

## Schedule

[edit]

The Election Commission of Pakistan announced the initial election schedule on
1 March 2024. Polling was conducted in the following five places on 9 March
2024:

  * Parliament House, Islamabad
  * Punjab Provincial Assembly, Lahore
  * Sindh Provincial Assembly, Karachi
  * Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Assembly, Peshawar
  * Balochistan Provincial Assembly, Quetta

Members of the Senate and National Assembly cast their votes at Parliament
House whereas members of Provincial Assemblies cast their votes at respective
assemblies.

## Electoral system

[edit]

The president of Pakistan is indirectly elected by the Electoral College of
Pakistan – a joint sitting of the Senate, National Assembly and Provincial
Assemblies.

The votes of the members of the Senate and National Assembly are counted as
single votes. Meanwhile, the votes given by the provincial assembly
legislators are adjusted to give each province an equal share in the election.
This is because each provincial assembly has a varying number of members,
depending on population size. The largest province by population size, Punjab,
has a total of 371 members in its assembly, whereas the smallest province of
Balochistan has only 65 members in its legislature. Therefore, the provincial
votes are weighted against the Balochistan assembly in the following
manner:[12]

Provincial Assembly  | Members  | Weightage of each vote  | Total votes   
---|---|---|---  
Balochistan | 65  | 1  | 65   
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa | 145  | 0.448  | 65   
Sindh | 168  | 0.387  | 65   
Punjab | 371  | 0.175  | 65   
  
Regarding timing, the constitution states that election to the office of
President must be held no earlier than sixty days and no later than thirty
days before the expiration of the term of the incumbent president. If
assemblies are not present, the constitution allows the election of the
president to be delayed thirty days after the general election.[_citation
needed_]

The electoral process itself is done via a secret ballot due to the post of
the president being constitutionally non-partisan. Therefore, unlike during
the election of the Prime Minister, cross-party voting is not liable to be
considered defection.[_citation needed_]

## Electoral College

[edit]

---|---  
  
The Electoral College of Pakistan is formed by a joint sitting of the six
following leading political bodies in Pakistan:

  * _TheSenate of Pakistan_
  * _TheNational Assembly of Pakistan_
  * _TheProvincial Assembly of the Punjab_
  * _TheProvincial Assembly of Sindh_
  * _TheProvincial Assembly of Balochistan_
  * _TheProvincial Assembly of Khyber Paktunkhwa_

The maximum strength of the Electoral College is 696. However, considering the
vacant seats, the electoral college for this presidential election stood at
679. A simple majority is required in a two-candidate contest to claim
victory. But in a three-candidate race, the victory requirement goes down
considerably depending on how the votes are split.

## Candidates

[edit]

On 15 December 2023, Faisal Karim Kundi, the spokesperson of the Pakistan
People's Party (PPP), announced that former President Asif Ali Zardari, who is
also the party's president, would be their presidential candidate for the 2024
elections.[13] The Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML(N)) also announced its
support for Zardari's candidacy.[14] Moreover, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement –
Pakistan (MQM–P), Balochistan Awami Party (BAP), Awami National Party (ANP),
and Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP) also announced their support for
Zardari.[15][16][17]

On 2 March 2024, the PTI-backed Sunni Ittehad Council nominated Mahmood Khan
Achakzai, the leader of the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PMAP), as their
presidential candidate.[18]

Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) and Jamat-e-Islami boycotted the election.[19][20]

## Results

[edit]

Asif Ali Zardari won the election by getting 411 electoral votes.

## Reactions

[edit]

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Zardari on his victory and said
that he would be “a symbol of the strength of the federation.” Mahmood Khan
Achakzai also congratulated Zardari, adding that his election was held in a
free and fair manner.[22]

PTI chair Gohar Ali Khan called Zardari's election "unconstitutional".[23]
