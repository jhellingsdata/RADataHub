The **2024 Ligurian regional election** is taking place in Liguria, Italy on
27–28 October 2024.[1] The snap election was called after the resignation of
incumbent president, Giovanni Toti, following an investigation into
corruption, particularly regarding favors to local businessmen in Genoa in
exchange for financial support in local elections in 2021 and 2022.[2][3]

Bucci won the electoral competition by outperforming his opponent in
Ventimiglia, Sanremo, Rapallo among other centers where his coalition reached
50 and 60% of the votes, while Orlando performed strongly in Genova, despite
Bucci being the city mayor there, and his home town of La Spezia, while also
winning in Savona as well.

The race brought significant attention as it was considered a test for the
national government but also for the center-right coalition in the region.

## Electoral system

[edit]

The Regional Council of Liguria is composed of 30 members, plus the president
elect. The president elect is the candidate winning a plurality of votes at
the election. Within the council, 24 seats are elected in provincial
constituencies by proportional representation. The remaining 6 councillors are
assigned as a majority bonus if the winning candidate has less than 18 seats,
otherwise they are distributed among the losing coalitions.[4]

A single list must get at least 3% of the votes in a province in order to
access the proportional distribution of seats, unless the list is connected to
a coalition with more than 5% of the vote.[4]

### Results by province and capital city

[edit]

Whilst the province of Imperia voted for Bucci by 24 points, in all the other
provinces the end result came within five points: Bucci won the province of
Savona by 3 points, whilst Orlando won by 2 points in the metropolitan City of
Genoa and by 4 points in the province of La Spezia.[6]

In the major cities, despite being the incumbent mayor of Genoa, Bucci lost in
his hometown to Orlando by 8 points but won Sanremo by 25.5 points and Imperia
by 9 points; whilst Savona voted for Orlando by 20 points and La Spezia by 5
points. Overall, Orlando's strongest areas were the three largest cities of
the region (Genoa, La Spezia, Savona) and their surrounding municipalities,
whilst Bucci was the strongest west of Savona and in the Tigullio area east of
Genova.[6][7] Orlando's strength in Savona can be attributed to opposition to
a regasification plant in nearby Vado Ligure that former president Toti had
proposed to build in a protected sea area.[8][9]
