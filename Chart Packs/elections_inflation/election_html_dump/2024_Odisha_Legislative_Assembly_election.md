**Legislative Assembly elections** were held in the eastern coastal state of
Odisha from 13 May to 1 June 2024 to elect the 147 members of the Odisha
Legislative Assembly. The votes were counted and results were declared on 4
June 2024 forming the 17th Assembly.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a simple majority with 78 seats and
created history by ending the 24 year rule of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) and
its leader Naveen Patnaik. On 12th June 2024, Mohan Charan Majhi, the MLA from
Keonjhar took oath as the 15th Chief Minister of the state, along with Kanak
Vardhan Singh Deo and Pravati Parida as deputy chief ministers.

## Background

[edit]

The tenure of sixteenth Odisha Legislative Assembly was scheduled to end on 24
June 2024.[1] The previous assembly elections were held in April 2019. After
the elections, Biju Janata Dal (BJD) formed the state government, with the
then incumbent Naveen Patnaik continuing as the Chief Minister.[2]

## Schedule

[edit]

The schedule of the election was announced by the Election Commission of India
on 16 March 2024.[3] The polling was held in four phases which coincided with
the phases 4 to 7 of the simultaneously held Indian General Election.[4]

BJD and BJP contested in all the 147 constituencies, whereas INC contested in
145 seats and provided support to other parties in the 2 remainder
constituencies. Election manifesto of BJD included 24 major promises like
youth empowerment, free electricity to farmers, zero interest loans to
businesswomen, tribal empowerment, infrastructure and sports development, food
security and good governance.[12] BJP's manifesto included 21 major points
like the start of "Samrudh Krushak Niti" under which paddy crop would receive
₹3,100 (US$37) price per quintal and "Subhadra Yojana" which would allow
₹50,000 (US$600) cash voucher to women. It also included development of
fishing industry, increasing road connectivity, providing 3.5 lakh jobs by
2029, increasing tourism and more. BJP also focused on reducing the corrupt
practices of the incumbent BJD government.[13]

Another important factor was the possibility of Naveen Patnaik, who had been
ruling for the last 24 years, being succeeded by his personal secretary V. K.
Pandian, a Tamil IAS officer. Pandian came into the good-books of Patnaik due
to his effective management of the COVID-19 pandemic in the state. In 2023,
Pandian quit his job in the state bureaucracy and joined the ruling BJD. The
BJP heavily campaigned on the prospect of BJD planning to make an "outsider"
like Pandian the next CM,[14] with Prime Minister Narendra Modi even alleging
that Pandian was secretly siphoning off money from the treasury of Puri's
Jagannath Temple,[15] a charge which Pandian vehemently denied.[16] Patnaik
refuted all rumours of Pandian being his successor.[17]

## Aftermath

[edit]

On 4 June 2024, BJP won 78 seats crossing the required majority mark of 74 and
thus won the elections. Mohan Charan Majhi was declared to be the Chief
Minister and was sworn in on 12 June to form the state government.[35][36][37]
15 other ministers took oaths, including Kanak Vardhan Singh Deo and Pravati
Parida as the Deputy CMs.[38]

Pandian was single-handedly blamed by the rank-and-file of BJD for its
spectacular loss in both state election and the simultaneously held Lok Sabha
elections. Following this massive backlash, Pandian decided to quit active
politics.[39]

BJD had nominated 34 women candidates, but only 5 could win. _The Hindu_
reported that although these women candidates were from political families,
winnability factor was ignored and strong anti-incumbency feeling amongst the
voters played an important role against them.[19] Ganesh Gaigouria, visiting
faculty of National Law School of India University, Bengaluru writing for
_Indian Express_ commented that major three reasons for loss of BJD in the
elections were fear of bureaucratisation of the state administration under
Pandian, religious polarization in the aftermath of communal riots between
Hindus & Muslims in Sambalpur last year[40] and identity politics over _Odia
Asmita_ (i.e. pride in being Odia) in the backdrop of the Tamil origin
Pandian's prospects of becoming CM. Gaigouria argues that BJP successfully
campaigned against BJD on these points and won the elections.[41]

Himanshu Sekhar Sahoo, who was elected from the Dharmasala seat as an
independent, rejoined the BJP.[42]
