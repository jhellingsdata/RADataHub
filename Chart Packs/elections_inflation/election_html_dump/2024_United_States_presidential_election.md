The **2024 United States presidential election** was the 60th quadrennial
presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 5, 2024.[7] The Republican
ticket of Donald Trump, who was the 45th president of the United States from
2017 to 2021, and JD Vance, the junior U.S. senator from Ohio, defeated the
Democratic ticket of incumbent U.S. vice president Kamala Harris and Tim Walz,
the governor of Minnesota.[8][9] Trump and Vance are scheduled to be
inaugurated as the 47th U.S. president and the 50th U.S. vice president
respectively on January 20, 2025, after their formal election by the U.S.
Electoral College.[10][11]

The incumbent president, Joe Biden of the Democratic Party, initially ran for
re-election,[12] and became the party's presumptive nominee, facing little
opposition;[13] however, what was generally considered to be a poor
presidential debate performance in June 2024 intensified concerns about his
age and health, and led to calls within his party for him to leave the
race.[14] Although initially adamant on remaining in the race, Biden withdrew
on July 21, 2024, becoming the first eligible incumbent president to withdraw
from the race since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968. He endorsed Harris, who was
voted the party's nominee by the delegates on August 5, 2024. Harris selected
Walz as her running mate.

Biden's predecessor, Trump, a member of the Republican Party, ran for re-
election for a second, non-consecutive term, after losing to Biden in
2020.[15] He was nominated during the 2024 Republican National Convention
along with his running mate, Vance, after winning the Republican primaries.
The Trump campaign was noted for making many false and misleading statements,
including the false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from
Trump,[16][17][18][19] engaging in anti-immigrant fearmongering,[d] and
promoting conspiracy theories.[20][21] Trump’s style and behavior, including
his embrace of far-right extremism[20][21] was characterized by a variety of
scholars as breaking with traditional U.S. political norms in an unprecedented
way, marked by a rhetoric they described as authoritarian and dehumanizing
toward his political opponents,[e] likening it to populist movements and some
drawing parallels to fascism.[22]

In May 2024, Trump was found guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business
records, becoming the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a
crime.[23] He remains under multiple indictments for his attempts to overturn
the 2020 election, his role in the January 6 attack, and his election
racketeering prosecution in the state of Georgia. Trump survived two
assassination attempts in the months before the election, the first in
Pennsylvania and the second in Florida.[24][25]

The presidential election took place at the same time as elections for 34
seats in the U.S. Senate, all seats in the U.S. House, 11 state governorships,
and legislatures in 44 states. Key swing states for the presidential election
included Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and
Wisconsin.[26] Leading campaign issues were abortion,[27][28][29] climate
change,[30][31] democracy,[32][33] the economy,[34] education,[35] foreign
policy (including U.S. support for Israel in the Israel–Hamas war),[36]
healthcare,[37] immigration,[38][39] and LGBTQ rights.[40] The economy had
consistently been cited by voters in polls as being the most important issue
in the election.[41][34]

Trump and Vance were projected by major media outlets in the dawn of November
6, 2024 as the 47th president and 50th vice president of the United States
respectively,[42] with Trump winning the electoral vote and the national
popular vote, unlike in 2016.[43] Harris conceded the race in a phone call to
Trump on November 6[44] and delivered a concession speech later that
day.[45][46]

Trump, so far, has flipped four states that had voted Democratic in 2020:
Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, and is maintaining his leads
in Arizona and Nevada.

Trump became the second president to be elected to a non-consecutive second
term, 132 years after Grover Cleveland defeated Benjamin Harrison in the 1892
election; Trump, at the age of 78, is also the oldest person ever to be
elected U.S. president.[47] Harris is the first Democratic presidential
nominee to lose the national popular vote since John Kerry in 2004.[48]

### Procedure

Main article: United States presidential election § Procedure

Article Two of the Constitution of United States states that for a person to
serve as president, the individual must be a natural-born citizen of the
United States, be at least 35 years of age, and have been a United States
resident for at least 14 years. The Twenty-second Amendment forbids any person
from being elected president more than twice. Major party candidates seek the
nomination through a series of primary elections that select the delegates who
choose the candidate at the party's national convention. Each party's national
convention chooses a vice presidential running mate to form that party's
ticket. The nominee for president usually picks the running mate, who is then
ratified by the delegates at the party's convention. If no candidate wins a
majority of their party's delegates' votes, or (in this election) a party's
presumptive nominee drops out of the race between the primaries and the
convention, a brokered convention may be held: the delegates are then
"released" and are free to switch their allegiance to a different
candidate.[49]

The general election in November is an indirect election, in which voters cast
ballots for a slate of members of the Electoral College; these electors then
directly elect the president and vice president.[50] Election offices are
dealing with increased workloads and public scrutiny. Officials in many states
have sought additional funding to hire more personnel, improve security, and
extend training. Numerous election offices are dealing with an increase in
retirements and are overwhelmed with public records requests, owing in part to
the electoral mistrust planted by former President Trump's loss in the 2020
election.[51][52]

Trump is the first president in American history to be impeached twice, and
the first to run again after impeachment. Trump was first impeached by the
Democratic-controlled House of Representatives in December 2019 for abuse of
power and obstruction of Congress due to his attempts to coerce Ukraine to
provide damaging information on Biden and misinformation regarding Russian
interference in the 2016 United States elections by withholding military
aid.[53] Trump's second impeachment by the House occurred on January 13, 2021,
for "incitement of insurrection" owing to his role in the January 6 United
States Capitol attack. As Trump was acquitted by the Senate in both cases,
Trump was not barred from seeking reelection to the presidency in 2024.[54]

The Colorado Supreme Court,[55] a state Circuit Court in Illinois,[56] and the
Secretary of State of Maine[57] ruled that Trump is ineligible to hold office
under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution
for his role in the January 6 Capitol attack, and thus attempted to disqualify
him from appearing on the ballot.[58][57] These attempts were unsuccessful, as
on March 4, 2024, the United States Supreme Court unanimously ruled that
states cannot determine eligibility for a national election under Section
3.[59]

#### Donald Trump's false claims of interference

Donald Trump's lies of a stolen election, and Republican Party efforts to

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/20240524_Trump_groundwork_for_election_denial.svg/200px-20240524_Trump_groundwork_for_election_denial.svg.png)To
sow election doubt, Trump escalated use of "rigged election" and "election
interference" statements in advance of the 2024 election compared to the
previous two elections. The statements have been described as part of a "heads
I win; tails you cheated" rhetorical strategy.[60]

Trump has made false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election,
and has continued denying the election results as of September
2024[update].[61][62] Election security experts have warned that officials who
deny the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election, may attempt to impede
the voting process, or refuse to certify the 2024 results.[63] _The New York
Times_ has reported that "the Republican Party and its conservative allies are
engaged in an unprecedented legal campaign targeting the American voting
system", by restricting voting for partisan advantage ahead of Election Day
and preparing to mount "legally dubious" challenges against the certification
process if Trump loses.[64]

In the lead up to the 2024 election, the Republican Party has made false
claims of massive "noncitizen voting" by immigrants, in an attempt to
delegitimize the election in the event of a Trump defeat.[65][66][67] The
claims have been made as part of larger Republican Party efforts to disrupt
the 2024 United States presidential election and election denial movement.[68]
Trump has continued spreading his "Big Lie" of a stolen election and has
predicted without evidence that the 2024 election would be rigged against him.
Trump has falsely accused Biden of "weaponizing" the Justice Department to
target him in relation to his criminal trials.[60] Trump and several
Republicans have stated they will not accept the results of the 2024 election
if they believe they are "unfair."[69]

Trump's previous comments suggesting he can "terminate" the Constitution to
reverse his election loss,[70][71] his claim that he would only be a dictator
on "day one" of his presidency and not after,[f] his promise to use the
Justice Department to go after his political enemies,[78] his plan to use the
Insurrection Act of 1807 to deploy the military for law enforcement in cities
and states with too much violent crime or drug cartels,[79][80] attempts to
overturn the 2020 United States presidential election, continued Republican
efforts to restrict voting following the 2020 presidential election, Trump's
baseless predictions of voter fraud in the 2024 election,[81] and Trump's
public embrace and celebration of the January 6 United States Capitol
attack,[82] have raised concerns over the state of democracy in
America.[83][84][85][86] Trump's political operation said that it plans to
deploy more than 100,000 attorneys and volunteers to polling places across
battleground states, with an "election integrity hotline" for poll watchers
and voters to report alleged voting irregularities.[87]

#### Interference by foreign nations

Main article: Foreign interference in the 2024 United States elections

Before the election, U.S. officials and former officials stated that foreign
interference in the 2024 election was likely. Three major factors cited were
"America's deepening domestic political crises, the collapse of controversial
attempts to control political speech on social media, and the rise of
generative AI."[88] China, Russia, and Iran have since all been identified as
mounting influence operations and attempts to interfere with the 2024
election. US intelligence officials have described the efforts as part of
broader efforts by authoritarian nations to use the internet to erode support
for democracy.[89]

##### China

Further information: Chinese interference in the 2024 United States elections

China has been identified as interfering with the 2024 election through
propaganda and disinformation campaigns linked to its Spamouflage operation.
US intelligence agencies described the effort as not targeting any particular
candidate, but focusing on issues important to the Chinese government such as
Taiwan, and "undermining confidence in elections, voting, and the U.S. in
general."[89] As early as April 1, 2024, _The New York Times_ reported that
the Chinese government had created fake pro-Trump accounts on social media
"promoting conspiracy theories, stoking domestic divisions and attacking
President Biden ahead of the election in November."[90]

##### Russia

Further information: Russian interference in the 2024 United States elections

According to disinformation experts and intelligence agencies, Russia spread
disinformation ahead of the 2024 election to damage Biden and Democrats, boost
candidates supporting isolationism, and undercut support for Ukraine aid and
NATO.[91][92] On September 4, 2024, the United States publicly accused Russia
of interfering in the 2024 election and announced several steps to combat
Russian influence including sanctions, indictments, and seizing of web domains
used to spread propaganda and disinformation. American intelligence agencies
have assessed that Russia prefers Trump to win the election, viewing him as
more critical of U.S. support for Ukraine.[93]

##### Iran

Further information: Iranian interference in the 2024 United States elections

Iran has been identified as interfering with the 2024 presidential election
through front companies connected to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps
through hacking attempts against the Trump, Biden, and Harris campaigns
starting as early as May 2024.[94] Iran has launched propaganda and
disinformation campaigns through fake news websites and accounts on social
media to tip the election against former president Trump. _The New York Times_
stated the efforts were an attempt at "sowing internal discord and
discrediting the democratic system in the United States more broadly in the
eyes of the world."[95][94][96]

### Voter roll purges

Further information: Republican efforts to restrict voting following the 2020
presidential election

Multiple Republican-led administrations have removed voters from their state's
voter rolls in the lead up to the election, which critics have argued violates
the National Voter Registration Act.[97][98][99]

In July 2024, 160,000 inactive or infrequent voters were removed from Ohio's
voter rolls.[100][101] The Ohio chapters of Common Cause and the League of
Women Voters threatened lawsuits against the state over the purge.[102][103]

In August 2024, Virginia governor Glenn Youngkin signed an executive order
removing 6,303 voters suspected of being non-citizens from Virginia's voter
rolls.[104][105] In October 2024, the Department of Justice sued the Virginia
Board of Elections and Virginia commissioner of elections over the voter
purge, alleging that it violated the National Voter Registration
Act.[106][107] The suit also found a number of alleged non-citizens purged
were actually citizens.[107][108] District judge Patricia Tolliver Giles ruled
that the removal was illegal, ordering the state to stop purging voter rolls
and to restore the voter registration of more than 1,600 voters who had been
removed.[109][108] The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals then upheld the
order.[110][111] The administration filed an emergency appeal to the Supreme
Court, which sided with Virginia in a 6–3 decision, allowing the state to
continue purging voter rolls.[112][111]

In August 2024, Alabama secretary of state Wes Allen announced a process for
purging 3,251 registered Alabama voters and referred them to the state
attorney general's office for criminal prosecution.[98][113] In September
2024, the Department of Justice sued Alabama for violating the National Voter
Registration Act.[114][115] In October 2024, district judge Anna Manasco ruled
in favor of the Department of Justice, ordering the state to restore the voter
registrations.[116][117] Alabama secretary of state's chief of staff Clay
Helms testified that 2,000 of the purged voters were legally registered
citizens.[117]

### Criminal trials and indictments against Donald Trump

Main article: Indictments against Donald Trump

Further information: Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (election obstruction
case), Georgia election racketeering prosecution, Federal prosecution of
Donald Trump (classified documents case), Prosecution of Donald Trump in New
York, and Personal and business legal affairs of Donald Trump

Trump has been found liable in civil proceedings for both sexual abuse and
defamation in 2023 and defamation in 2024, while also being criminally
convicted of 34 felonies related to falsifying business records, expected to
be an issue during the campaign. He has four criminal indictments totaling 86
felony counts and there are other lawsuits against Trump.[118] On May 30,
Trump was found guilty by a jury of all 34 felony counts in _The People of the
State of New York v. Donald J. Trump_ over falsifying business records for
hush money payments to pornographic film star Stormy Daniels, to ensure her
silence about a sexual encounter between them, to influence the 2016
presidential election. This makes Trump the first former U.S. president to be
convicted of a crime in American history.[119] Trump and many Republicans have
made numerous false and misleading statements regarding Trump's criminal
trials, including false claims that they are "rigged" or "election
interference" orchestrated by Biden and the Democratic Party, of which there
is no evidence.[120][60]

Trump faces an additional 52 felony counts; 4 counts in a _United States of
America v. Donald J. Trump_ for his alleged role in attempting to overturn the
2020 United States presidential election and involvement in the January 6
United States Capitol attack; 8 counts in _The State of Georgia v. Donald J.
Trump, et al._ for his alleged attempts to overturn the results of the 2020
United States presidential election in Georgia; 40 counts in _United States of
America v. Donald J. Trump, Waltine Nauta, and Carlos De Oliveira_ relating to
his hoarding of classified documents and alleged obstruction of efforts to
retrieve them.[121]

In addition to his indictments, on May 9, 2023, Trump was found liable by an
anonymous jury[122] for sexual abuse/rape[g][h] in _E. Jean Carroll v. Donald
J. Trump_ and ordered to pay a total of $88.3 million combined for damages and
defamation.[128][129][130] In September 2023, Trump was found guilty of
financial fraud and ordered to pay a $457 million judgement currently on
appeal.[131]

According to an April 2024 Reuters/Ipsos poll, the percentage of registered
voters who found Trump's charges somewhat to very serious in the federal
elections case was 74%, 72% in the Georgia case, 69% in the classified
documents case, and 64% in the New York hush money case.[132] Nearly a quarter
of Republican voters said they would not vote for Trump if found guilty of a
felony by a jury.[131] Following his hush money conviction, 15% of likely
Republican voters and 49% of independents stated they wanted Trump to drop
out, and 54% of registered voters approved of the jury's decision.[133]
Polling also found 56% of Republicans who were unchanged by the verdict, and
35% of Republicans and 18% of independents who stated they were more likely to
vote for Trump.[134]

Trump has been noted for attempting to delay his trials until after the
November election. If Trump wins the election in November, then on January 20,
2025, Trump could order a new attorney general to dismiss the federal charges
he is facing, prevent the state charges from taking affect through a variety
of methods, and issue a presidential self-pardon.[135][136]

On July 1, 2024, the US Supreme Court delivered its 6–3 decision in _Trump v.
United States_ , along ideological lines, ruling that Trump had absolute
immunity for acts he committed as president within his core constitutional
purview, at least presumptive immunity for official acts within the outer
perimeter of his official responsibility, and no immunity for unofficial
acts.[137][138][139] Thus, Trump's sentencing date for his convictions in New
York was delayed from July to September 2024,[140] and then to November
26,[141] and the trial dates in Trump's other cases will likely be delayed as
well, to review the applicability of the Supreme Court's decision.[142][143]

### Age and health concerns

#### Joe Biden

Main article: Age and health concerns about Joe Biden

Former president Trump and mass media raised concerns about President Biden's
age, including his cognitive state, during and after the 2020 United States
presidential election.[144] These concerns increased after a poor performance
by Biden during a debate against Trump in the 2024 presidential election,
which led a number of commentators and some Democratic lawmakers to call for
Biden to drop out of the 2024 presidential race.[145] He later withdrew his
candidacy while stating that he would continue serving as president until the
conclusion of his term.[146]

According to a February 2024 poll, Biden's age and health were major or
moderate concerns for 86% of voters generally,[144] up from 76% earlier in
2020.[147] According to another 2024 poll, most of those who voted for Biden
in 2020 said they believed he was too old to be an effective president; _The
New York Times_ noted that these concerns "cut across generations, gender,
race and education".[148]

#### Donald Trump

Main article: Age and health concerns about Donald Trump

According to polling released in July and August, a majority of voters polled
after the first debate think Trump, who is 78 years old, is too old to serve a
second term (51%,[149] 57%,[150] and 60%[151]), with 80% unsure he would be
able to finish out a second term.[149] During and after Trump's presidency,
comments on his age, weight, lifestyle, and history of heart disease have
raised questions about his physical health.[152] In addition, numerous public
figures, media sources, and mental health professionals have speculated that
Trump may have some form of dementia, which runs in his family.[152] Experts
for the science publication STAT who analyzed changes in Trump's speeches
between 2015 and 2024 noted shorter sentences, more tangents, more repetition,
and more confusion of words and phrases. The doctors suggested it could just
be due to changes in mood or it could indicate the beginning of
Alzheimer's.[153] The sharp rise in all-or-nothing thinking is also linked to
cognitive decline.[153] _The New York Times_ reported that Trump's 2024
speeches had grown "darker, harsher, longer, angrier, less focused, more
profane and increasingly fixated on the past" and that experts considered this
increase in tangential speech and behavioral disinhibition as a possible
consequence of advancing age and cognitive decline.[154] Trump has also been
criticized for his lack of transparency around his medical records and
health.[155][152]

### Political violence and threats

Main article: Political violence in the 2024 United States presidential
election

See also: Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign § Violent and dehumanizing
statements, and Second American Revolution

On July 14, Biden gave an address condemning political violence, including the
attempted assassination of Trump, arguing for the need to "lower the
temperature" in American politics.

Several scholars, lawmakers, intelligence agencies, and the members of the
public have expressed concerns about political violence surrounding the 2024
election.[156][157] The fears come amidst increasing threats and acts of
physical violence targeting public officials and election workers at all
levels of government.[158][159] Trump has been identified as a key figure in
increasing political violence in America both for and against
him.[160][161][162] Political violence is at its highest since the 1970s, and
most recent violence has come from right-wing assailants.[163][164] Trump has
increasingly embraced far-right extremism, conspiracy theories such as Q-Anon,
and far-right militia movements to a greater extent than any modern American
president.[20][21] Trump has espoused dehumanizing, combative, and violent
rhetoric and promised retribution against his political enemies.[e] Trump has
played down but refused to rule out violence following the 2024 election,
stating "it depends".[171] Trump has suggested using the military against "the
enemy from within" on Election Day that he described as "radical left
lunatics", Democratic politicians, and those who oppose his
candidacy.[172][173]

#### Assassination attempts

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Former_President_Donald_Trump_paying_respect_to_Corey_Comperatore_%2853887491621%29.jpg/220px-

Trump standing alongside the fire department uniform of Corey Comperatore, who
was killed during the attempted assassination of Trump

On July 13, 2024, Trump survived an assassination attempt while addressing a
campaign rally near Butler, Pennsylvania.[24] Trump was shot and wounded on
his right ear by Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old man from Bethel Park,
Pennsylvania,[174][175] who fired eight rounds with an AR-15–style rifle from
the roof of a building located approximately 400 feet (120 meters) from the
stage; the shots killed audience member Corey Comperatore and critically
injured two other audience members.[174] Seconds later, Crooks was shot and
killed by the U.S. Secret Service's counter-sniper team.[176] The motive and
cause of the assassination attempt are still under investigation by
authorities.[177] On September 11, 2024, a bipartisan Senate report identified
tech issues and other preventable mistakes by the Secret Service during the
event.[178]

On September 15, 2024, Trump survived a separate assassination attempt at
Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. The suspect did not
fire his weapon, and no deaths or injuries were reported.[25] The suspect,
Ryan Routh, is in custody.[179]

#### Violence towards election workers

Since the 2020 election and continuing into the 2024 election, the election
denial movement in the United States has prompted thousands of death threats
directed at election workers, officials, and their families, with some
receiving letters laced with fentanyl.[180][181] As of March 2024, the
Department of Justice's Election Threats Task Force had charged 20 people with
threat-related crimes.[182] In September 2024, suspicious packages were sent
to state election officials in Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma, Massachusetts,
Missouri, Nebraska, Tennessee, and Wyoming. This resulted in evacuations in
several states. The inclusion of white powder in most of the packages mirrored
the 2001 anthrax attacks, but the substance in the Oklahoma delivery was
identified as flour.[183] Threats have led some election workers to resign and
have affected recruitment of temporary poll workers.[184][185] Efforts to
protect election workers are diverse, and have included active shooter
training, provision of first aid kits and Narcan, bulletproof vests,
bulletproof glass, metal detectors, physical barriers, armed guards, police
snipers, drones, and security cameras.[184] However, many locations lack the
funds to implement such measures.[185]

During early voting in San Antonio, Texas, a voter was arrested and charged
for allegedly assaulting an elderly poll worker. The worker reportedly asked
the man multiple times to remove his MAGA hat at the polling location. In
Texas, it is illegal to wear any clothing showing support of political
candidates while in a polling location.[186]

#### Violence towards voters

On October 30, 2024, a male teenager in Jacksonville, Florida, was arrested
for aggravated assault and improper exhibition of a dangerous weapon after
brandishing a machete at two women outside an early voting center. He along
with seven other teenagers, allegedly approached and antagonized members of
the opposing political party as they were demonstrating. Neither the
teenager's nor the women's political parties were disclosed, although later
posts by the Duval Democratic Party described the teenager's party as a "group
of young men carrying Trump flags".[187]

On November 1, 2024, a voter wearing a "Let's Go Brandon" hat was reportedly
struck by a poll worker after a verbal altercation over his hat at an
Orangeburg County, South Carolina polling location. It is illegal to wear
anything supporting a candidate whose name is on the ballot, but wearing a
general political message is permitted by South Carolina law.[188]

#### Arson of ballot boxes

In late October 2024, multiple fires were reported at ballot drop boxes in
Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, Washington. The fires damaged hundreds of
ballots, requiring election officials to identify and offer new ballots to
those affected by the fires. Prior to the fires, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security had issued a bulletin
raising concerns that "election-related grievances" could motivate domestic
extremist activity and that ballot drop boxes could potentially be "attractive
targets".[189][190] In Phoenix, Arizona, a fire was started in a mail
collection box, destroying some ballots and other mail. A suspect was arrested
and claimed that the fire was unrelated to the election.[191]

This is the first presidential election to occur after the reapportionment of
votes in the United States Electoral College following the 2020 United States
census and 2020 United States redistricting cycle.[192][193][194]

### Swing states

Further information: Red states and blue states and Swing state

Most states are not electorally competitive, and due to cultural differences
tend to vote for the same political party every election. Because of the
nature of the Electoral College, this means that a limited number of swing
states—competitive states that "swing" between the parties—are vital to
winning the presidency. These are the Rust Belt states of Wisconsin, Michigan,
and Pennsylvania; and the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and
North Carolina.[26]

## Campaign issues

### Campaign themes

See also: Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign § Platform, Donald Trump
2024 presidential campaign § Platform, and 2024 United States elections §
Issues

#### Harris campaign

Harris has framed her campaign as "a choice between freedom and chaos" and
based it around the ideals of "freedom" and "the future".[195][196] The Harris
campaign has sought to highlight her experience as an attorney general and a
prosecutor to "prosecute the case" against Trump by pointing out his 34 felony
convictions and the impacts of the overturning of _Roe v. Wade_.[197][198]
Harris is running as a moderate Democrat who has moved towards the center on
several policy positions since her 2019 primary run, embracing many of Biden's
domestic policy stances.[199] Harris has focused her economic proposals on the
cost of groceries, housing and healthcare.[200] She has also focused on the
middle class, and small businesses.[201] Harris' campaign has been noted for
having an optimistic and joyful tone.[202][203]

#### Trump campaign

See also: Trumpism and Rhetoric of Donald Trump

A central campaign theme for Trump's second presidential bid is
"retribution".[204][205] Trump framed the 2024 election as "the final battle,"
and openly promised to leverage the power of the presidency for political
reprisals.[206] Trump is heavily running on immigration as a central campaign
focus. Trump's campaign has focused on dark and apocalyptic rhetoric about the
state of the country and predicting doom if he does not win.[207][208][209]
_The Associated Press_ states that "Trump's rallies take on the symbols,
rhetoric and agenda of Christian nationalism."[210] During his 2024
presidential campaign, Trump has made numerous false and misleading
statements.[16][17][18] The large number of lies and false statements have
been attributed to Trump's rhetorical style described as using the big lie and
firehose of falsehood propaganda technique.[211][212] Trump has also made many
personal attacks against Harris,[213] several of which are sexual in
nature,[22] have been characterized as racist and misogynistic,[214][215][216]
and are considered a further breach of political norms.[22] Trump's harsher
rhetoric against his political enemies has been described by historians,
scholars, commentators and former generals as populist, authoritarian,
fascist,[i] and unlike anything a political candidate has ever said in
American history.[217][231][226]

### Abortion

Washington, D.C., on May 14, 2022, as part of the Bans Off Our Bodies protest
following the leaked draft opinion overturning _Roe v. Wade_

Abortion access is a key topic during the campaign.[232][38] This is the first
presidential election to be held in the aftermath of the 2022 _Dobbs v.
Jackson Women's Health Organization_ decision, in which the Supreme Court
overturned _Roe v. Wade_ , leaving abortion law entirely to the states,
including bans on abortion.[233] The three justices appointed by former
president Trump—Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh, and Neil Gorsuch—all voted
to overturn the federal right to an abortion in _Dobbs_.[234] By April 2023,
most Republican-controlled states had passed near-total bans on abortion,
rendering it largely illegal throughout much of the southern United States.
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, there are 15 states that have _de
jure_ early-stage bans on abortion without exceptions for rape or incest.[233]

Abortion will be on the ballot in up to ten states in 2024, including the
swing states of Arizona and Nevada.[235] Some pundits have argued abortion
rights referenda could help Harris in November.[236][237][238]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/March_for_Life_%2849435740948%29.jpg/220px-
March_for_Life_%2849435740948%29.jpg)Trump speaking at the 2020 March for Life
in Washington, D.C.

Democrats predominantly advocate for abortion access as a right,[239] while
Republicans generally favor significantly restricting the legality of
abortion.[240] Since becoming the presumptive nominee, Harris has indicated
her support for passing legislation which would restore the federal abortion
right protections previously guaranteed by _Roe_.[241][242] She argued Trump
would let his anti-abortion allies implement Project 2025 proposals to
restrict abortion and contraception throughout the US.[243]

Trump has claimed credit for overturning _Roe_ , but criticized Republicans
pushing for total abortion bans.[244][245] Trump has said he will leave the
issue of abortion for the states to decide, but would allow red states to
monitor women's pregnancies and prosecute them if they have an abortion.[246]
In his home state of Florida, Trump announced he would vote No on Amendment 4,
an abortion rights referendum, preserving the six-week ban.[247] The
announcement came one day after he initially criticized the six-week ban for
being "too short" and said he would vote to lengthen it.[248] Trump has
repeated a false claim that Democrats support abortions after birth and
"executing" babies.[249][250]

### Border security and immigration

Main articles: Mexico–United States border crisis and Border security in the
United States

Further information: Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign § Immigration,
and Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign § Immigration

Border security and immigration are among the top issues concerning potential
voters in the election.[251][252] Polling has shown that most Americans want
to reduce immigration[253] and that a substantial minority of white
Republicans are concerned about white demographic decline.[254] In 2023 and
early 2024, a surge of migrants entering through the border with Mexico
occurred.[255] By June 2024, illegal crossings reached a three-year low
following four consecutive monthly drops, which senior officials attributed to
increased enforcement between the US and Mexico, the weather, and Biden's
executive order increasing asylum restrictions.[256]

Attorney General Kamala Harris at the border in 2011 to discuss strategies to
combat transnational gang crime

Harris has promised to fight for "strong border security" coupled with an
earned pathway to citizenship. Harris has highlighted her work in combating
transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers while attorney
general.[257] In 2023, as vice president, Harris announced pledges of US$950
million from private companies into Central American communities to address
the causes of mass migration, such as poverty.[242] Harris states she believes
the immigration system is "broken" and needs to be fixed, and she says most
Americans believe this.[242] Harris also advocates for stricter asylum rules
than president Biden.[258] Harris supports increasing the number of Border
Patrol agents and accuses Trump as being unserious on border security.[259]
While vice president, Harris supported a bipartisan bill which would have
funded additional border agents and closed the border if too crowded, the bill
was rejected by Trump. Trump called on House and Senate Republicans to kill
the bill arguing it would hurt his and Republican's reelection campaigns and
deny them the ability to run on immigration as a campaign
issue.[260][261][262][263][264][265] Harris has criticized Trump for his
opposition to the bill on the campaign trail,[257] and has promised to sign
the bill into law as president.[266]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/President_Trump_Travels_to_Arizona_%2850040937841%29.jpg/220px-
President_Trump_Travels_to_Arizona_%2850040937841%29.jpg)Trump has pledged to
finish the wall on the southern border if elected.

Trump has stated that if elected, he would increase deportations, send the
U.S. military to the border, expand ICE detentions through workplace
raids,[267] deputize local law enforcement to handle border security, increase
Customs and Border Patrol funding as well as finish building the wall on the
southern border.[268] Trump has said he will deport both legal and illegal
immigrants.[269][270] _The New York Times_ reported that Trump is considering
"an extreme expansion of his first-term crackdown on immigration," such as
"preparing to round up undocumented people already in the United States on a
vast scale and detain them in sprawling camps while they wait to be
expelled."[267] Trump has stated his intention to deport 11 million people
through the construction of detention camps and using the military[246]
through the 18th century Alien Enemies Act.[225] Trump has made false claims
of a "migrant crime wave" that are not supported by data, and has provided no
evidence to back up his claims.[271][272]

Trump's anti-immigrant nativist[273] tone has grown harsher from his previous
time as president,[267] and has used fearmongering,[d] racial
stereotypes,[273] and more dehumanizing rhetoric when referring to illegal
immigrants. Trump has repeatedly called some immigrants subhuman, stating they
are "not human", "not people", and "animals"[283][284][285] who will "rape,
pillage, thieve, plunder and kill" American citizens,[269] that they are
"stone-cold killers", "monsters", "vile animals", "savages", and "predators"
that will "walk into your kitchen, they'll cut your
throat"[281][282][269][272] and "grab young girls and slice them up right in
front of their parents".[269] Other rhetoric includes false statements that
foreign leaders are deliberately emptying insane asylums to send "prisoners,
murderers, drug dealers, mental patients, terrorists"[286] across America's
southern border as migrants, that they are "building an army" of "fighting
age" men to attack Americans "from within"[287] and are the "enemy from
within" who are ruining the "fabric" of the country.[225] Since fall
2023,[288] Trump has claimed that immigrants are "poisoning the blood of our
country," which has drawn comparisons to racial hygiene rhetoric used by white
supremacists and Adolf Hitler.[289][290][288][167] In the 20 rallies since
Trump's debate with Harris, _Politico_ found his rhetoric, especially around
immigrants, getting darker, citing experts who found it strongly echoed
authoritarian and Nazi ideology, including claims that immigrants are
genetically predisposed to commit crimes and have "bad genes".[225][291]
Trump's comments come as part of violent, dehumanizing rhetoric Trump has
increasingly utilized during his campaign.[161][283][166][167][168][169]

### Climate change

Main article: Climate change in the United States

Further information: Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign § Climate change
and energy; and Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign § Energy, environment,
and climate change

See also: Environmental policy of the Donald Trump administration, Climate
change denial, and Inflation Reduction Act

Climate change and energy policy have played a role in the 2024 presidential
campaign. In 2023, the United States saw a record in crude oil production with
over 13.2 million barrels of crude per day beating the 13 million barrels per
day produced at the peak of Trump's presidency.[292] America also dealt with
supply shocks caused by the 2021–2024 global energy crisis due to the COVID-19
pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine.[293]

Harris is an advocate for environmental justice to address the impact of
climate change on lower-income areas and people of color. Under Biden, she
supported his climate legislation.[242] Harris helped pass the Inflation
Reduction Act,[294] the largest investment in addressing climate change and
clean energy in US history[295] putting the US on track to meet emissions
reduction targets by 50–52% below 2005 levels by 2030.[296] Harris's campaign
has stated that she does not support a ban on fracking.[297][298][199]

Trump has ridiculed the idea of man-made climate change[299][300][301] and
repeatedly referred to his energy policy under the mantra "drill, baby,
drill."[302] Trump says he will increase oil drilling on public lands and
offer tax breaks to oil, gas, and coal producers. Trump has stated his goal
for the U.S. to have the lowest cost of electricity and energy of any country
in the world.[303] Trump has promised to roll back electric vehicle
initiatives, proposed once again leaving the Paris Climate Accords, and
rescinding several environmental regulations.[303][304] Trump has stated his
intention to roll back parts of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.[305] The
implementation of Trump's plans will add around 4 billion tons of carbon
dioxide to the atmosphere by 2030, having also effects on the international
level. If the policies will not change further, it will add 15 billion tons by
2040 and 27 billion by 2050. The exact calculation is difficult, but the
researchers state that "Regardless of the precise impact, a second Trump term
that successfully dismantles Biden's climate legacy would likely end any
global hopes of keeping global warming below 1.5C."[306]

The election is the first presidential election following Trump's attempts to
overturn the 2020 election and the January 6 United States Capitol attack. It
also comes amidst Trump's federal indictment for attempting to overturn the
2020 election and involvement in the attack and racketeering charges for
attempting to overturn Joe Biden's victory in the state of Georgia.

Polling before the election has indicated profound dissatisfaction with the
state of American democracy.[307][308][309] Liberals tend to believe that
conservatives are threatening the country with Christian nationalist
autocratic tendencies and their attempts to overturn the 2020 election.[310]
According to an October 25 ABC/Ipsos poll, 49% of Americans see Trump as a
fascist, described as "a political extremist who seeks to act as a dictator,
disregards individual rights and threatens or uses force against their
opponents." Meanwhile, only 22% saw Harris as a fascist by this
definition.[311] Some Republicans are concerned that Trump's former
impeachment and four criminal indictments are attempts to influence the
election and keep him from office.[312] However, there is no evidence that
Trump's criminal trials are "election interference" orchestrated by Biden and
the Democratic Party.[120][60] Trump has repeated false claims that the 2020
election was rigged and stolen from him.[19]

Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign has been criticized by legal
experts, historians, and political scientists for making increasingly violent
and authoritarian statements,[313][314][315] which some believe the Trump
campaign is intentionally leaning into.[316] Trump's platform calls for the
vast expansion of presidential powers and the executive branch over every part
of the federal government.[317] Trump has called for stripping employment
protections for thousands of career civil service employees and replacing them
with political loyalists if deemed an "obstacle to his agenda" within federal
agencies, the United States Intelligence Community, State Department, and
Department of Defense.[318] Trump has repeatedly stated his intention to have
the Justice Department investigate and arrest his domestic political rivals,
judges, prosecutors, and witnesses involved in his criminal
trials.[319][320][321] A large number of scholars, historians, commentators,
former Trump officials and generals have described Trump as a fascist.[i]
Trump has said his political opponents are a greater threat to the United
States than countries such as Russia, China, and North Korea,[168][322] and
has urged deploying the military on American soil to fight "the enemy from
within" which he describes as "radical left lunatics" and Democratic
politicians such as Adam Schiff.[323] Trump has repeatedly voiced support for
outlawing political dissent and criticism he considers misleading or
challenges his claims to power.[324][325] Trump has previously tried to
prosecute his political rivals and would have fewer checks on his power in a
second term.[326]

Project 2025 is a proposed plan by the Heritage Foundation to centralize power
into the executive branch for conservative policies to be enacted without
input from the judicial branch, legislative branch or local government. The
plan received some support from the Republican Party. The document was written
in part by former members of the Trump administration, such as Russell Vought
and John McEntee,[327] while Trump stated he is unfamiliar with parts of the
plan.[328][329][330]

Trump's campaign has been noted for using increasingly dehumanizing and
violent rhetoric against his political
opponents.[161][283][331][167][332][333] Calling the January 6, 2021, Capitol
attack a "day of love," Trump has promised to pardon those charged for their
involvement and has called those charged "hostages" and "great, great
patriots."[334][335][336][337] Trump has played down but not ruled out
violence after the 2024 election if he does not win, stating, "it
depends."[338] Harris was tasked by Biden with protecting democracy through
voting rights legislation through her work on the For the People Act. Harris
has supported efforts to defend election workers and counter Republican
efforts to restrict voting following the 2020 presidential election.[242]
Harris has stated her support to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and John Lewis
Rights Voting Rights Advancement Act if elected.[339]

Inflation_2018-2024_US_vs._EuroZone.png)Post-COVID inflation spike in the US,
with the gray column indicating the COVID-19 recession in US

Voters consistently cited the economy as their top issue in the 2024
election.[41] Following the COVID-19 pandemic, a global surge in inflation
ensued that raised prices on many goods, though the U.S. inflation rate had
declined significantly during 2023 and 2024.[340][341][342] _The New York
Times_ reported that both candidates "embraced a vision of a powerful federal
government, using its muscle to intervene in markets in pursuit of a stronger
and more prosperous economy."[343] _The Wall Street Journal_ reported that
economists found Trump's proposed policies created a greater risk of stoking
inflation and generating higher budget deficits, relative to the Harris
plan.[344] Twenty-three Nobel Prize-winning economists signed a letter
characterizing the Harris economic plan as "vastly superior" to the Trump
plan.[345] Trump's designated government efficiency leader Elon Musk said in
October that he expected Trump's plan would involve more than $2 trillion in
federal spending cuts and would cause "some temporary hardship."[346][347]

Harris is running on a pro-union platform.[348] She has promoted the passage
of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, funding for small business, and
previously supported an act as senator to provide a $6,000 tax credit for
middle and low-income families.[242] Harris has promised to address price
gouging, bring down costs, ban hidden fees and late charges from financial
institutions, limit "unfair" rent increases and cap prescription drug costs
which she has said would "lower costs and save many middle-class families
thousands of dollars a year".[349]

_The New York Times_ described Harris' economic policy as embracing "the idea
that the federal government must act aggressively to foster competition and
correct distortions in private markets." Harris has proposed raising taxes on
corporations and high-earners to fund services for the lower and middle
classes and reduce the deficit.[343] Harris has stated she supports increasing
the top tier capital gains tax rate to 28%, up from 20% and lower than Biden's
proposed 39.6%. Harris has stated her support for a Billionaire Minimum Income
Tax, increasing the tax on stock buybacks to 4%, and a ten-fold tax reduction
for small business ranging from $5,000 to $50,000 in relief.[350] Harris also
supports efforts to create a tax on unrealized gains for those with more than
a $100 million in net worth if they do not pay a minimum 25% tax rate on their
income inclusive of unrealized gains so long as 80% of said wealth is in
tradeable assets. The plan would impact a small percentage of America's
wealthy, and Axios reported most tech founders and investors would be
spared.[351] Harris has also announced support for restoring the corporate tax
rate to 28% among several other tax proposals to raise taxes and close
loopholes for corporations and the wealthy that would bring in $5 trillion in
additional revenue over 10 years.[352] Harris has also proposed tax breaks to
companies delivering economic benefit, such as manufacturing technologies to
fight global warming and building affordable housing. Harris has proposed a
ban on corporate price gouging to "help the food industry become more
competitive."[343] Harris has also expressed support for student debt
relief,[353] and Harris says she supports raising the minimum wage.[354]

Harris says she will increase home construction to reduce housing costs,
arguing that it negatively impacts the economy and hurts working-class
families. Harris has proposed directing $40 billion to construction companies
to build starter homes. Harris has promised to send $25,000 in down-payment
assistance to every first time home buyer.[343] Harris says she will urge
Congress to enforce fair housing laws and pass a bill to bar property owners
from using services that "coordinate" rents through the passage of the
Preventing the Algorithmic Facilitation of Rental Housing Cartels Act, and
also call on Congress to pass the Stop Predatory Investing Act by removing tax
benefits to Wall Street firms that buy up large numbers of single-family
homes.[355][356]

Trump has proposed further individual and corporate tax cuts beyond his prior
2017 tax cuts.[357] Trump has argued that keeping taxes low for the wealthy
increases job creation,[358] and that these policies coupled with a crackdown
in illegal immigration and reduction in inflation will help the middle
class.[353] Trump says he will reduce regulation of business through the
creation of an efficiency commission led by Elon Musk,[359] along with
reducing environmental regulation. By October 2024, Musk was Trump's second-
largest individual campaign donor.[360] Trump has said deporting millions of
immigrants will bring housing prices down, though most economists argue it
could raise prices by removing construction workers who use less real
estate.[343][361] Trump and Harris support not taxing tips for at least
hospitality and service workers.[354][362]

Trump's stated trade policy involves the United States decoupling from the
global economy and having the country become more self-contained and exerting
its power through individual trade dealings. This would be attempted largely
through a universal baseline tariff[363] of 10% to 20% on all
imports,[364][365] with increased penalties if trade partners manipulate their
currency or engage in unfair trade practices.[303] Trump has called for 100%
tariffs on cars made outside the U.S. and a minimum 60% tariff on Chinese
goods.[364] Trump stated his plans to urge Congress to pass a "Trump
Reciprocal Trade Act" to bestow presidential authority to impose a reciprocal
tariff on any country that imposed one on the United States.[303] _The
Washington Post_ reported in January 2024 that Trump was preparing for a
massive trade war.[366] Trump's trade policies have been described as
protectionist,[367] neomercantilist or autarkist.[363][368] Increasing
inflation has become a more common critique of Trump's economic
plans.[369][370][371][372] In June 2024, 16 Nobel Prize in Economics laureates
signed an open letter arguing that Trump's fiscal and trade policies coupled
with efforts to limit the Federal Reserve's independence would reignite
inflation in the United States.[373][374][375] Moody's[376] and most
economists surveyed by the _WSJ_ in July 2024 predict that inflation would be
worse under Trump than Biden, a result due in part to tariffs, a crack down on
illegal immigration, and larger deficits.[377] Trump incorrectly insists
foreign exporters pay tariffs imposed by the U.S. government; American
importers pay tariffs on goods upon arrival at U.S. ports, meaning tariffs are
taxes that raise prices for imported products Americans buy.[378][379][380]
One non-partisan analysis estimated the proposed tariffs would cost $1,700 per
year for the average household.[380] The China–United States trade war Trump
initiated in 2018 by imposing tariffs on China was widely characterized as a
failure for the United States by the end of Trump's presidency.[381] The
Committee for a Responsible Budget found that Trump's plans would grow that
national debt at roughly twice the rate of Harris' plan,[382] while the
Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found Trump's plan would only
benefit the top 5% of earners.[383]

Trump has suggested that he will abolish the federal income tax and replace it
with tariffs. In June 2024, Trump discussed the idea of eliminating the income
tax in a private meeting with Republican politicians.[384] In October 2024,
Trump suggested that he would scrap the income tax if he wins, pointing out
that tariffs were the main sources of revenue in the 19th century.[385]

### Education

Main article: Education in the United States

Further information: Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign § Education,
2020s controversies around critical race theory, and Parental rights movement

Trump has pledged to terminate the Department of Education,[303][386][387]
claiming it has been infiltrated by "radical zealots and Marxists."[388] At
the American Federation of Teachers national convention, Harris attacked
recent efforts to ban books in school libraries.[389] She has also previously
called for raising teachers' wages.[390]

### Healthcare issues

Further information: Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign § Healthcare,
and Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign § Healthcare and social services

Healthcare and drug policy have been discussed during the 2024 presidential
election, such as around the future of the Affordable Care Act.[391]

Harris has supported efforts to strengthen coverage under the Affordable Care
Act (also known as Obamacare),[298] including setting caps on seniors' out-of-
pocket prescription drug prices at $2,000 and limiting the cost of insulin for
those on Medicare to $35 enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act.[294]
Harris has been a proponent of White House efforts to ban medical debt from
credit reports.[353] Harris has stated she no longer supports a single-payer
healthcare system.[298] Harris has supported the expanded child tax credit
enacted in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 that reduced child poverty by
20%.[294] Harris has expressed support for making child care and elder care
more affordable and enacting paid family leave.[353] On August 16, 2024,
Harris announced the proposal of a $6,000 child tax credit, expanding her
populist economic agenda. Other policies including broadening a cap on
prescription drug costs and permanently reinstating the expanded child tax
credit.[392]

Trump has continued to advocate repealing the Affordable Care Act during the
2024 election, as he did while in office.[37] During an interview on March 11,
2024, Trump suggested he was open to cutting entitlement programs such as
Social Security and Medicare, which the Trump campaign later claimed was
merely referring to "cutting waste" and that he would protect the programs.
Trump previously suggested while president in 2020 that he would "at some
point" look into cutting entitlement programs, and Trump's previous budget
proposals have suggested some cuts to the programs.[393][394] JD Vance and
Mike Johnson have also suggested cuts to Obamacare, including around pre-
existing conditions, were part of Trump's plan.[395] On the issue of
subsidized care, Harris has stated she will "maintain and grow" the Affordable
Care Act.[396][397]

Trump has collaborated with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on his "Make America Healthy
Again" agenda and appointed some Kennedy allies to his transition team. The
Trump campaign has said that he will form a panel of experts and will charge
them with looking into the causes of the upward trend in chronic disease
patients.[398] In October 2024, Trump said that he would let Kennedy "go wild"
when it comes to policies on food, medicine, and health.[399]

Biden signing Executive Order 14065 in February 2022 in response to Russia's
imminent invasion of Ukraine. The United States has given billions worth of
military aid to Ukraine following the Russian invasion of the country in 2022.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Israel–Hamas war and Chinese goals of
expansion were some of the main foreign policy issues of the election. Harris
signaled she would generally follow Biden's foreign policy on NATO and
Ukraine, supporting both in the aftermath of the Russian invasion.[242][400] A
supporter of the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict,[242][401] Harris was expected to continue Biden's approach,[402] but
she is seen as tougher on Israel and more sympathetic to Palestinians than
Biden or Trump.[400] Harris advocated for "de-risking" from China, a policy
that encourages reducing Western economic dependence on China.[403] Harris was
expected to continue deepening American alliances in Asia and the Pacific with
the intention of curbing China's rising power both economically and
militarily.[404]

Trump's 2024 campaign promoted an isolationist "America First" foreign
policy.[405][406] Trump said that America's allies "treat us actually worse
than our so-called enemies", adding "We protect them and then they screw us on
trade", and vowed to impose tariffs on trade partners; economists said this
could spark trade wars.[407] He promised to "fundamentally reevaluate" NATO,
shifting the US's defense spending from Europe towards Asia.[303] Although
NATO members are obliged to defend any other member who is attacked, Trump
said he would encourage Russia to "do whatever the hell they want" to NATO
allies that did not spend enough on defense.[408] NATO Secretary-General Jens
Stoltenberg responded: "Any suggestion that allies will not defend each other
undermines _all_ of our security".[409] Trump vowed that even before he is
inaugurated,[410] he will negotiate an end to the Russo-Ukrainian War in one
day.[411] He promised to quickly cut the amount of military and financial aid
to Ukraine,[412] and make Europeans reimburse the U.S. the cost of rebuilding
its old stockpiles.[410] Trump previously said he might recognize Russia's
illegal annexation of Crimea,[413] and suggested the 2022 invasion could have
been prevented by Ukraine giving up parts of its own country to Russia.[405]
Trump is seen as more pro-Israel and less sympathetic to Palestine than Biden
or Harris.[414] Trump promised a tougher stance against China,[415] but also
questioned whether America should defend ally Taiwan.[416] Trump suggested
withdrawing troops from South Korea if it does not pay more to support U.S.
troops there.[246]

#### Israel–Hamas war views

Further information: Israel–Hamas war protests in the United States and
Israel–Hamas war protest vote movements

Polling has indicated that the majority of voters support a ceasefire and
American mediation in the Israel-Hamas war.[417] According to a YouGov poll in
March 2024, 52% of Americans supported stopping weapons shipments to Israel,
coming largely from Americans who voted for Biden in 2020 (62% support) and
people who did not vote in 2020 (60%). Republicans opposed halting weapons
shipments by 25 points.[418] Republicans generally support arms to Israel,
while Democrats are divided on the issue.[419]

Harris was expected to largely continue Biden's approach to the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict,[402] but she is seen as tougher on Israel and more
sympathetic to Palestinians than Biden or Trump.[400] Following Hamas's attack
on Israel in 2023, Harris at first supported Israel's offensive,[420][402]
saying "the threat Hamas poses to the people of Israel must be
eliminated".[242] However, she has since criticized Israel's actions and the
Gaza humanitarian crisis.[400] In March 2024, Harris opposed Israel's invasion
of Rafah,[242] called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza,[402][242] and called
the situation in Gaza a "humanitarian catastrophe".[242] Harris supports
continued aid to Israel and Palestine, but insists that Israel should agree to
a ceasefire and hostage deal and both sides should towards a two-state
solution.[421] In the Democratic primaries, the Uncommitted National Movement
led a protest campaign against Biden over the war, calling for a ceasefire and
arms embargo on Israel. It received over 700,000 votes and 36 delegates.[422]
Harris is seen as more sympathetic to Palestinians, and she and her campaign
interacted more with Arab-American and Uncommitted leaders.[423][424] However,
Harris refused to halt weapons shipments to Israel or shift policy much from
Biden, saying Israel has a right to defend itself.[425][426] By October,
Uncommitted encouraged its members to vote for Harris.[427]

Trump, during his first term as president, brought in more pro-Israel policies
than any president before. He presented himself as a stronger defender of
Israel, and is seen as less sympathetic to Palestine than Biden or
Harris.[414] Trump is expected to continue arming Israel, likely with "no
strings attached" for humanitarian concerns, unlike Harris.[428] He voiced
strong support for Israel's war on Hamas and Gaza, saying that Israel must
"finish the problem".[429] Trump said he would "crush" pro-Palestinian
protests, deport non-citizen protesters, and "set the movement back 25 or 30
years".[430][431] Trump would ban Gaza residents from entering the U.S..[432]
At times, he has also been critical of Israel's war in Gaza, saying Israel
should "get it over with ... get back to peace and stop killing
people".[433][434]

### LGBTQ rights

United States

Further information: Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign § LGBTQ rights,
Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign § LGBTQ rights and civil rights, and
2020s anti-LGBTQ movement in the United States

In recent years, conservative politicians in state legislatures have
introduced a growing number of bills that restrict the rights of LGBTQ people,
especially transgender people.[435][436]

Harris is a strong supporter of LGBTQ people's rights.[437] She has denounced
legislative attacks on transgender rights in states across the
country.[438][439]

Trump has promised to roll back policies regarding transgender
individuals.[440] Trump stated he will rescind Biden's Title IX protections
"on day one" for transgender students using bathrooms, locker rooms, and
pronouns that align with their gender identities.[441] Trump has stated he
would enact a federal law that would recognize only two genders and claimed
that being transgender is a concept only recently manufactured by "the radical
left."[442] Trump has pledged "severe consequences" for teachers who "suggest
to a child that they could be trapped in the wrong body." Trump previously
withdrew Title IX provisions that allowed transgender youth to have access to
the bathrooms of their choice, and he attempted to roll-back several
transgender-related policies in the Affordable Care Act.[440] Trump has
repeated a false claim that children undergo transgender surgery while at
school, without parental knowledge or consent.[443][444]

2024 Republican presidential primaries  

Nikki Haley

Donald Trump

Trump, the then-incumbent president, was defeated by Biden in the 2020
election and is not term-limited to run again in 2024, making him the fifth
ex-president to seek a second non-consecutive term. When he won, Trump became
the second president to win a non-consecutive term, after Grover Cleveland in
1892.[445] Trump filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election
Commission (FEC) on November 15, 2022, and announced his candidacy in a speech
at Mar-a-Lago the same day.[446][447] Trump was considered an early
frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination.[448] Trump had
announced in March 2022 that his former vice president Mike Pence would not be
his running mate.[449] In civil proceedings, Trump has been found liable for
sexual abuse and defamation in 2023, defamation and financial fraud in 2024,
becoming the first former president to be convicted of a crime.[23]

In March 2023, Trump was indicted over his hush money payments to adult film
actress Stormy Daniels.[450] Trump was again indicted in June over his
handling of classified documents that contained materials sensitive to
national security. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all the charges related to
these indictments.[451][452]

Trump faced opposition in the primaries, with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis
seen as the main challenger to Trump for the Republican nomination; he had
raised more campaign funds in the first half of 2022 and had more favorable
polling numbers than Trump by the end of 2022.[453][454][455] On May 24, 2023,
DeSantis announced his candidacy on Twitter in an online conversation with
Twitter CEO Elon Musk. "American decline is not inevitable—it is a choice...I
am running for president of the United States to lead our great American
comeback," DeSantis said. His campaign stated to have raised $1 million in the
first hour following the announcement of his candidacy.[456] Speaking on _Fox&
Friends_, he stated that he would "destroy leftism" in the United States.[457]
At the end of July 2023, FiveThirtyEight's national polling average of the
Republican primaries had Trump at 52 percent, and DeSantis at 15.[458]

Following the Iowa caucuses, in which Trump posted a landslide victory,
DeSantis and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy dropped out of the race and endorsed
Trump, leaving the former president and Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina
governor who served in Trump's cabinet, as the only remaining major
candidates.[459][460] Trump continued to win all four early voting contests
while Haley's campaign struggled to gain momentum.[461] On March 6, 2024, the
day after winning only one primary out of fifteen on Super Tuesday, Haley
suspended her campaign.[462][463]

On March 12, 2024, Trump officially became the presumptive Republican
presidential nominee.[464]

Trump was injured in an assassination attempt on July 13, 2024, when a bullet
grazed his ear.[465] This was the first time a president or major party
presidential candidate was injured in an assassination attempt since Ronald
Reagan in 1981.[466] Trump faced another assassination attempt on September
15, 2024, though he was not injured.[467]

On July 15, 2024, the first day of the Republican National Convention, Trump
officially announced that Senator JD Vance of Ohio would be his running
mate.[468] When he was elected, he became the first marine and first Iraq War
veteran to serve as vice president.[469]

On July 18, 2024, Trump accepted the nomination from the Republican National
Convention to become the Republican presidential nominee. This was the third
consecutive election in which he was the Republican nominee.[470]

## Democratic Party

Main articles: 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries and 2024
Democratic Party presidential candidates

On April 25, 2023, President Biden officially announced his bid for re-
election, confirming that Vice President Harris would remain his running
mate.[471][472] Following this announcement, Republicans increased their focus
on Harris, intensifying criticism against her.[473] During late 2021, amid
Biden's declining approval ratings, speculation arose regarding whether he
would seek re-election.[474] Public figures, including former Representatives
Carolyn Maloney, Tim Ryan and Joe Cunningham, urged Biden not to
run.[475][476][477]

Concerns about Biden's age were prominent, given that he was the oldest person
to assume the office at age 78, which would make him 82 at the end of his
first term and 86 at the end of a potential second term.[478] An April 2023
poll indicated that 70 percent of Americans, including 51 percent of
Democrats, believed Biden should not seek a second term, with nearly half
citing his age as the reason. Biden's approval rating stood at 41 percent,
with 55 percent disapproving, according to the FiveThirtyEight national
polling average.[479] Speculation also arose that Biden might face a primary
challenge from the Democratic Party's progressive faction.[480][481] However,
after Democrats outperformed expectations in the 2022 midterm elections, many
believed Biden's chances of securing the party's nomination had
increased.[482]

Author Marianne Williamson was the first to challenge Biden by announcing her
candidacy in February 2023.[483] In April 2023, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also
entered the race but later shifted his campaign to an independent run on
October 9, 2023.[484] Representative Dean Phillips joined the race on October
26, 2023;[485] he withdrew in March 2024 and endorsed Biden.[486][487]
Williamson initially withdrew from the race in February 2024 but later resumed
her campaign, only to end it again on June 11, 2024.[488][489][490]

Jason Palmer, who surprised many by winning the American Samoa caucuses,
became the first candidate to win a contested primary against an incumbent
president since Ted Kennedy in 1980. However, he suspended his campaign on May
15, 2024.[491] On March 12, 2024, Biden secured a majority of delegates,
becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee.[492]

Biden addressing the nation from the Oval Office on his decision to withdraw
from the race, July 24, 2024

Despite securing the nomination, Biden faced significant opposition from
"uncommitted" voters and the Uncommitted National Movement, who collectively
garnered more votes than several major contenders in the 2020 Democratic
primaries and won 36 delegates.[493] Following a widely panned debate
performance against Trump on June 27, 2024, Biden withdrew from the race on
July 21, endorsing Harris as his successor.[494] Harris quickly announced her
campaign and secured enough delegate endorsements by July 22, becoming the
presumptive nominee.[495]

Biden's withdrawal made him the first eligible incumbent president since
Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 not to seek re-election, and the first to withdraw
after securing enough delegates to win the nomination.[496] Harris is the
first nominee who did not participate in the primaries since Vice President
Hubert Humphrey, also in 1968.[497]

Following Biden's withdrawal, Tim Walz, Josh Shapiro, Mark Kelly, and Andy
Beshear emerged as lead candidates in the veepstakes.[498] Shapiro received
pushback from pro-Palestine activists for comments on college protesters[499]
and for claiming to volunteer for the IDF,[500] while Kelly was criticized by
labor groups.[501]

The Democratic Party conducted a virtual roll call vote on August 2, where
Harris secured the majority of delegate votes and became the official nominee
on August 5.[502] She selected Walz as her running mate the following
day.[503]

## Third-party and independent candidates

Main article: Third-party and independent candidates for the 2024 United
States presidential election

A number of independent candidates have announced presidential runs, most
notably Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West.

Several third parties, including the Libertarian Party, the Green Party, the
Party for Socialism and Liberation, the Constitution Party, and the American
Solidarity Party have also announced presidential nominees.[504]

Kennedy dropped out of the race in August 2024, though he remained on the
ballot in many states. The No Labels organization abandoned its efforts to run
a centrist candidate in April 2024.[505]

### Electoral College forecasts

Elections analysts and political pundits issue probabilistic forecasts of the
composition of the Electoral College. These forecasts use a variety of factors
to estimate the likelihood of each candidate winning the Electoral College
electors for that state. Most election predictors use the following ratings:

  * "_tossup_ ": no advantage
  * "_tilt_ " (used by some predictors): advantage that is not quite as strong as "lean"
  * "_lean_ " or "_leans_ ": slight advantage
  * "_likely_ ": significant, but surmountable, advantage
  * "_very likely_ " (used by some predictors): massive advantage that is stronger than "likely"
  * "_safe_ " or "_solid_ ": near-certain chance of victory

Below is a list of states considered by one or more forecast to be
competitive; states that are deemed to be "safe" or "solid" by forecasters

## Debates

Main article: 2024 United States presidential debates

In April 2022, the Republican National Committee voted unanimously to withdraw
from the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD).[546] In May 2024, the Biden
campaign proposed hosting two debates outside of the CPD timetable and
refusing to participate in CPD-hosted debates. Biden and Trump agreed to
debates on CNN on June 27 and ABC News on September 10.[547] The Harris camp
suggested that another debate could be held in October after the September 10
debate with Trump.[548] On September 12, Trump announced that there would be
no third presidential debate.[549]

### June 27 presidential debate: Biden vs. Trump

Main article: Joe Biden–Donald Trump 2024 presidential debate

CNN hosted the first major debate of the election on June 27 in Atlanta, with
51 million viewers watching.[550] Media outlets characterized Biden's debate
performance as a "disaster". Some pundits noted that he frequently lost his
train of thought and gave meandering, confused answers.[551][552][553]

G. Elliott Morris and Kaleigh Rogers of ABC News' _538_ argued that Biden had
failed to reassure voters that he was capable of serving as president for
another four years.[554] After the debate, elected officials, party
strategists, and fundraisers conversed about replacing Biden as the party's
candidate, including whether prominent Democrats should make a public
statement asking him to step aside.[555] In response, Biden initially stated
that he would not be dropping out, and prominent Democratic politicians,
including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, reiterated their support for Biden
following the debate.[556][557][558] The debate performance led to Biden
ultimately withdrawing his bid for re-election on July 21.[559]

### September 10 presidential debate: Harris vs. Trump

Further information: 2024 United States presidential debates § September 10:
Second presidential debate (ABC, Philadelphia)

The second presidential debate was held on Tuesday, September 10 by ABC
News[560] with 67.1 million viewers watching.[561] Trump had proposed a debate
on Fox News instead of the ABC debate,[562] but later accepted the debate on
ABC.[563] The debate was held at the National Constitution Center in
Philadelphia and lasted for about 100 minutes.[564] ABC's debate topics
included abortion, the economy, foreign policy, and immigration.[565] Most
news organizations declared Harris the winner of the debate,[p] and polling
showed voters thought Harris won the debate by what _The Washington Post_
described as a "historically large" margin.[575] During the debate, Trump made
numerous false assertions and extreme statements, including false claims about
immigrants eating pets and Democrats supporting infanticide.[576] CNN found
that Trump made over 30 false claims during the debate, but Harris only made
one.[577] Republicans attributed Trump's low debate performance to their
perception of biased debate moderation by ABC News, because the moderators
fact-checked him more than four times but did not fact-check Harris.[578][579]

### October 1 vice presidential debate: Vance vs. Walz

Further information: 2024 United States presidential debates § October 1: Vice
presidential debate (CBS, New York City)

Vice presidential candidates JD Vance and Tim Walz participated in a debate
hosted by CBS News on October 1 at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York
City.[580][581] Topics discussed during the debate included immigration,
abortion, and the economy.[582][583] Fact checking was primarily done online
only,[584] with Vance making more false and misleading claims than Walz.[585]

Forty-three million viewers watched the debate.[586] Many debate watchers
viewed the debate as "positive" and "civil". According to polling, both
candidates polled about even among viewers who were asked who won the
debate,[587] while Vance was considered the winner by a majority of
columnists.[q]

### Minor debates and forums

States presidential election § Debates and forums

Various debates and forums were held, sponsored by the Free & Equal Elections
Foundation.[595]

## Aftermath

### Election night

A Voice of America report on Trump's victory.

NewsNation was the first TV network to call the race for Trump; the network
relied on data from Decision Desk HQ, and the projection was made at 1:22 a.m.
EST on November 6th.[596] Fox News projected Trump as the winner at 1:47 a.m.
before CNN, the three major broadcast networks, and the Associated Press began
declaring towards his favor at 2:25 a.m.[597] In a convention center in West
Palm Beach, Florida, he was greeted with cheers by supporters, chanting, "USA!
USA! USA!" when Fox News declared him the winner. Trump claimed victory in a
speech to his supporters, where he was joined on stage by his family and his
running mate, JD Vance, saying; "America has given us an unprecedented and
powerful mandate." Harris did not speak to her supporters, who had gathered at
Howard University, her alma mater. Her campaign co-chair, Cedric Richmond,
briefly addressed the crowd, saying Harris would speak publicly on
Wednesday.[598] A few hours later, other media outlets would also project
Trump as the 47th president of the United States, with Associated Press
describing it as an "extraordinary comeback for a former president".[599] On
November 6, 2024, a day after the election night, Harris delivered her
concession speech at Howard University.[600]

### International reactions

election

### Other reactions

Wall Street's main indexes reported record highs on the day after election
night, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 3.57%, the S&P 500 up 2.53%,
and Nasdaq up 2.95%.[601] Elon Musk, a prominent Trump supporter and the CEO
of Tesla Motors, saw a nearly $20 billion increase in his fortune following a
post-election surge in the company's stock by 12% to a high of $288 per
share.[602]

Former president George W. Bush, who had refused to endorse either candidate,
offered his congratulations to Trump and said that what he defined as a "...
strong turnout" in the election was a "sign of the health of our republic and
the strength of our democratic institutions."[603]

### "Stolen election" conspiracies

Following Trump's victory, social media users on X shared election denial
conspiracy theories, claiming that millions of ballots were "left uncounted"
and there being something "not right" with the election.[604] Such posts
falsely claiming Trump "stole" the election peaked at noon the day after at
94,000 posts per hour, with many receiving amplification and gaining over a
million views each.[604] According to Gordon Crovitz, the CEO of the media
rating system NewsGuard, the phrase "Trump cheated" received 92,100 mentions
on the platform since midnight until the Wednesday morning after.[604]

One major "basis" these false claims were founded upon was that Joe Biden won
20 million more votes in his prior election bid than Harris did in hers.[605]
At the time these fallacies were disseminated, votes were still being counted
in many states.[604][606] An estimate around the time using the Associated
Press vote percentage total found that 16.2 million votes across twenty states
and Washington D.C. had yet to be counted.[606] Statistical analysis of voting
asserted that despite continued counting, the projections were already set and
new ballots would not sway the outcomes of any of the states and D.C.[606]
U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency director Jen Easterly
refuted the false claims, and wrote in a statement that there was "no evidence
of any malicious activity that had a material impact on the security or
integrity of our election infrastructure".[604]
