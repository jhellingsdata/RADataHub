General elections were held in Tuvalu on 26 January 2024.[1][2] There are no
political parties in Tuvalu and all candidates run as independents.

Two major issues in the election were the Falepili Union treaty, which
requiries both Tuvalu and Australia to "mutually agree" Tuvalu's foreign
security arrangements in exchange for allowing Tuvaluans displaced by climate
change to immigrate to Australia, and the country's diplomatic recognition of
Taiwan within the context of great power competition between the United States
and China for influence in the region.[3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]

Feleti Teo was appointed as prime minister on 26 February 2024 after having
been elected unopposed by the parliament.

## Background

[edit]

The previous election in 2019 saw a high turnover among the 16 members of
parliament, seven of whom were the first-term members. Several cabinet
ministers lost their seats. There were two female candidates, and Dr Puakena
Boreham retained a seat in parliament.[11] In the vote for prime minister,
held shortly after the election, parliament elected Kausea Natano, defeating
the incumbent head of government Enele Sopoaga, who had served since
2013.[12][13] The defeat of Sopoaga, who was pro-Taiwan, caused some to
speculate that the new prime minister would sever ties with Taipei in favour
of China.[14] The Solomon Islands, another Pacific Islands country, had made
the switch days before.[15] However, Prime Minister Natano later assured that
Tuvalu would maintain its diplomatic ties and recognition of Taiwan.[12] As of
2024, Tuvalu is one of only 12 countries that have official diplomatic
relations with Taiwan.[16]

### Falepili Union treaty

[edit]

In November 2023, Prime Minister Natano signed the Falepili Union treaty with
Australia. A significant factor of the treaty grants a pathway for 280
citizens of Tuvalu to migrate to Australia each year to enable climate-related
mobility for Tuvaluans. In exchange, the agreement allows Australia an
effective veto power over Tuvalu's foreign security agreements as the 2
countries must "mutually agree" such security agreements.[17] Natano said the
treaty was essential in preserving Tuvalu's identity.[18] However, former
Prime Minister Sopoaga claimed the Falepili Union would undermine the
country's sovereignty and vowed to repeal it should he head a government again
after the election.[4][17] Sopoaga emphasised the sensitivity of conserving
the sovereignty of the Pacific Island nations amidst a period where bigger
countries, such as the United States and China, are competing for influence in
the region. Former Foreign Minister Simon Kofe also criticised the treaty and
pledged to renegotiate with Australia. Kofe highlighted Tuvalu's contracts
with numerous international companies, including those that provide the
country with satellite connections and questioned if it were necessary for
Tuvalu to require Australia's permission to engage with such companies.[19]

## Electoral system

[edit]

The 16 members of parliament are elected from eight two-seat constituencies
via plurality block voting.[12][20][21] There are no formal political parties
in Tuvalu, so all candidates contest as independents.[19] Candidates are
required to be Tuvaluan citizens and at least 21 years old. If, by the
registration deadline, no more than two eligible candidates have registered to
run in a constituency, these nominees are then, on that day, declared by law
to be elected. Candidates have until the day before the election to withdraw
if they wish to. All citizens aged 18 and older are eligible to vote; voting
is not compulsory.[21][22] There are about 6,000 eligible voters in this
election.[23]

## The election

[edit]

Voting began on 26 January 2024 at 8:00 local time (UTC+12:00), concluding at
16:00.[24] The elections officer said turnout was high as voting
commenced.[25]

Six new MPs were elected to Tuvalu's 16-member parliament.[26] Significant
changes to the composition of the parliament include the incumbent Prime
Minister Kausea Natano, as well as Dr Puakena Boreham - the only female member
of the legislature - not retaining their seats.[26][27][28][29] The former
Governor General Sir Iakoba Italeli was elected as an MP along with Feleti
Teo, the former Executive Director of the Western and Central Pacific
Fisheries Commission (WCPFC).[26][30]

Enele Sopoaga, the prime minister from 2013 to 2019, was re-elected in the
Nukufetau electorate.[26] Former foreign minister Simon Kofe retained his seat
in the Funafuti electorate.[28][5][30]

No candidates contested the sitting MPs Seve Paeniu, who was the finance
minister, and Namoliki Sualiki in the electorate of Nukulaelae, so they were
automatically returned to parliament.[26][25]

## Aftermath

[edit]

After the results are released, ships were sent to pick up winning candidates
in order for them to assemble in the capital Funafuti,[31] although dangerous
sea conditions delayed their travel.[32][33][34][35] Election commissioner
Tufoua Panapa said that the members of the new parliament would convene to
vote for a prime minister, at a time notified by the governor general.[25]

There are three groups of MPs in the new parliament: six newly elected
members; six members of the last government; and four from the previous
opposition group.[35]

On 26 February 2024, Feleti Teo was appointed as prime minister, after he was
elected unopposed by the parliament,[36][37][38][39][40] and on 27 February
2024 Teo appointed the members of the Cabinet.[41][42]

Teo was a member of the eminent persons panel which worked with the
governments of Tuvalu and Australia to draft the Falepili Union.[43][44] In a
statement published by Simon Kofe on 28 February 2024, the Teo government gave
support for the "broad principles and objectives" of the Falepili Union, while
noting "the absence of transparency and consultations in socializing and
informing the public in Tuvalu of such an important and groundbreaking
initiative";[45] and indicated that Tuvalu will seek changes to make it
"workable".[46][47]

The statement of 28 February 2024 also address Tuvalu's relations with Taiwan:
"The new government wishes to reaffirm its commitment to the long-term and
lasting special relationship between Tuvalu and the Republic of China,
Taiwan".[45][47][48]

In his first interview as prime minister, Teo said "[o]ur ties with Taiwan are
purely based on democratic principles and they have been very loyal to
us."[49] Teo said the part of the Falepili Union he wanted to revisit was that
both countries must "mutually agree" on any security arrangements that Tuvalu
may want with other countries.[49]

In a later interview Teo said that “[i]f there is a way that stops short of
revising the treaty that guarantees the integrity of the sovereignty of
Tuvalu, then we will certainly explore those options.”[50] Subsequently Teo
said he wanted arrangements to guarantee Tuvalu’s sovereignty that "stop short
of revising the treaty."[51]

Teo has said that his government's top priority was climate change,[44] and
the development challenges Tuvalu faces include the need to improve medical
and educational services to Tuvalu’s outer islands.[50]

## Reactions

[edit]

After the formation of the new government, the Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, officially the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China,
sent a presidential delegation led by Deputy Foreign Minister Tien Chung-kwang
to Tuvalu as a show of support for newly elected Prime Minister Feleti
Teo.[52][53][54]

The Australian foreign minister Penny Wong said that the country looked
forward to working with the new government.[23] Australia’s Department of
Foreign Affairs and Trade responded to the concerns about the Falepili Union
by saying the treaty “recognises that the statehood and sovereignty of Tuvalu
will continue”.[50] On 26 March 2024, Pat Conroy, Australia’s Pacific
minister, tabled the Falepili Union treaty in the Australian Parliament for
the propose of obtaining ratification of the treaty. Conroy stated “[t]he new
government of Tuvalu has confirmed its desire to proceed with the Falepili
Union”.[55] Conroy confirmed that Australia would work with Tuvalu to ensure
its sovereignty was respected. Conroy also stated that “Australia commits to
assist Tuvalu in responding to a major natural disaster, a health pandemic, or
military aggression. This is predicated on Tuvalu requesting such
assistance.”[55]
