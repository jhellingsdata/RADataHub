Presidential elections were held in the Comoros on 14 January 2024.[1][2]
Election officials initially announced on 16 January that incumbent president
Azali Assoumani had been re-elected with 63% of the vote,[3] with a voter
turnout of just 16%.[4] However, the Supreme Court [fr] approved a set of
results that showed Assoumani receiving 57% of the vote, with voter turnout at
56%.

## Background

[edit]

The election was viewed as a referendum on the presidency of Azali Assoumani,
who faced opposition from five other candidates. Opposition candidates pledged
to unite behind a single candidate should no candidate reach a majority of the
vote in the 14 January election, which would trigger a runoff election on 25
February. The opposition candidates shared the slogan "Azali Nalawe" ("Azali,
get out"). Ten days before campaigning began, Harimia Ahmed, the senior
Supreme Court magistrate responsible for monitoring the elections, was
dismissed through a decree by Assoumani.[5]

Assoumani campaigned on the slogan "Gwa Ndzima" ("knock out in one go"),
signaling his intent to win an outright majority in the first round. He
pledged to continue his ongoing projects such as increased infrastructure,
turning the country into a tourist destination and raising Comoros'
international profile through his assumption of the rotating presidency of the
African Union. He also blamed the "coronavirus crisis" for adversely affecting
his track record.[5]

## Electoral system

[edit]

Until 2018, the presidency of the Comoros rotated between the country's three
main islands: Anjouan, Grande Comore and Mohéli. The 2010 elections were
limited to Mohélian candidates and the 2016 elections, which were tainted by
violence and allegations of irregularities, saw candidates from Grande Comore
contest the elections.[6][7] The next presidential election would have seen a
president elected from Anjouan.

However, a constitutional referendum in July 2018 saw voters approve
constitutional amendments that scrapped the rotation system and instituted a
standard two-round system in which a candidate has to receive a majority of
the vote in the first round to be elected, with a second round held if no
candidate is able to win in the first round.[8] The changes also moved the
next presidential elections forward to 2019 and allowed incumbent President
Azali Assoumani to run for another term.[9]

The referendum led to violent protests and an armed uprising in Anjouan in
October 2018, which was stopped by the military after several days.[10]

## Results

[edit]

On 16 January 2024 Idrissa Said Ben Ahmada, the head of the Comorian election
commission, announced that Assoumani had received 63% of the vote, precluding
a run-off. His nearest rival, Salim Issa Abdillah, received 20%. However, the
commission noted that only 55,258 voters had voted in the presidential
election, which was boycotted by some opposition candidates, a turnout of just
16%. The commission also said that 189,497 voters voted in the concurrent
gubernatorial elections for each of the country's three islands. [4][7][11]

The Supreme Court validated the election results on 24 January. However, the
body provided different figures from the results released by the electoral
commission, saying that Assoumani had won the election with 57.2% of the vote,
and putting turnout in the presidential vote at 56%, or equivalent to 191,297
voters.[12]

## Aftermath

[edit]

At a gathering of his supporters, Assoumani called his reelection "a strong
moment for our country, which is doing everything in its power to consolidate
democracy." However, his opponents called for the results to be annulled,[13]
alleging that electoral irregularities and fraud such as irregularities in the
lists of precinct members, ballot-stuffing, early closure of polling stations
had occurred and disruptions of voting by soldiers had occurred,[5][7][14] and
noted that two-thirds of the electorate had turned out to vote for governors
of the islands.[3] Salim Issa Adillah, the second-placer in the vote, warned
that the opposition had "an action plan that we will roll out at the right
moment". Despite the opposition's claims, international observers said the
election was carried out in a free and fair way with "peace and
tranquility".[4][7]

### Post-election protests and violence

[edit]

On 17 and 18 January, violent protests broke out in the capital Moroni
following the announcement of Assoumani's victory, with demonstrators
ransacking and burning a former minister's residence, setting the car of an
incumbent minister on fire, looting the national food depot and blocking
roads. Police responded by firing tear gas and making arrests, with reports
that security forces opened fire on a women's march.[3][15] Authorities
subsequently declared a nighttime curfew from 10 pm until 6 am on 18 January,
although the curfew was implemented at 7 pm in Moroni, Bambao [fr], and
Itsandra [fr].[16] A government spokesman accused the opposition of organising
the protests,[3][15] while opposition candidate Mohamed Daoudou [fr] expressed
solidarity with what he called a "spontaneous movement". At least one person
was reported to have been killed and at least 25 others, including a seven-
year-old child, were injured. One of the injured was described as in serious
condition. Internet access was also severely disrupted.[17]

Reacting to the violence, Volker Türk, the United Nations High Commissioner
for Human Rights, urged Comoran authorities to "ensure a safe environment,
where all Comorans, including members of the political opposition, can freely
express their views and exercise their right to peaceful assembly," as well as
to release arbitrary detainees, investigate human rights violations in the
pre-election period and bring the perpetrators to justice.[3] The US embassy
said that the official election results "raised serious concerns that must be
addressed to maintain the peace and the well-being of the nation", and called
on the electoral commission and Comorian authorities to "to ensure full
transparency and clarify the results it announced."[18]

All five opposition candidates called for a national day of protest against
the election results to be held on 19 January,[19] which went unheeded.[20]

On 20 January, Mohamed Daoudou, who claimed to have "proof" of fraud, filed an
appeal with the Supreme Court to request the annulment of the election results
and the holding of new elections.[21] However, on 24 January, the Supreme
Court dismissed the case along with other such lawsuits coinciding with its
validation of the election results.[12]

## Reactions

[edit]

China congratulated Assoumani on his victory.[22]
