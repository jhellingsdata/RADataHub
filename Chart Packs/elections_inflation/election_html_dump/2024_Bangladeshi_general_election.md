General elections were held in Bangladesh on 7 January 2024 in accordance with
the constitutional requirement, stating that elections must take place within
the 90-day period before the expiration of the current term of the Jatiya
Sangsad on 29 January 2024. The Awami League, led by incumbent Sheikh Hasina,
won the election for the fourth consecutive time with less than 10% of the
eligible voters voting according to an Election Commission, which is run by
the ruling political party.[6][3][7][8] The party won 224 seats while
independent candidates, most of whom were Awami League members propped up as
dummy candidates to give a semblance of competition, won 62 seats.[9][10][11]

In the lead-up to the election, the incumbent government led by Sheikh Hasina
cracked down on opposition parties and silenced critics of the
government.[12][13][14] Hasina's prime ministership has been described as
authoritarian since being re-elected in 2008,[15][16][17][18] and in 2011
removed the requirement that a temporary independent caretaker government be
formed to hold elections. The main opposition party, the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party, boycotted the elections (as they did in 2014) as they
assumed that the election commission under the incumbent government were
unable to organise a free and fair election.[14]

A protest over the election turnout emerged as the Chief Election Commissioner
initially claimed, based on the data at hand, that turnout was 28%, but later
retracted that statement to claim turnout was around 40%.[10][8]

The United States Department of State, in a statement, said that the election
was not free and fair[19] and the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development
Office termed the election lacking the preconditions of democracy.[20]
According to The Economist, through this election, Bangladesh effectively
became a one-party state.[21]

Early elections are expected to be called, after Sheikh Hasina was forced to
resign and the 12th Jatiya Sangsad was dissolved and was replaced by an
interim government headed by Muhammad Yunus amidst popular student protests in
the country in August.[22]

## Background

[edit]

The Awami League won the 2018 general elections and formed the government.[23]
The first session of the parliament sat on 30 January 2019. As the tenure of a
parliament lasts five years in Bangladesh,[6] the Sangsad was scheduled to
expire on 29 January 2024.

The main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), demanded
that the government hand over power to a neutral caretaker government before
the next elections.[24] This has been rejected by Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina, who vowed that "Bangladesh will never allow an unelected government
again".[25] Hasina's resistance to a caretaker government arose following the
2006–2008 crisis, during which a caretaker government assumed military control
of the country and arrested a number of political leaders, including Hasina
and BNP leader Khaleda Zia.[26] Zia was sentenced to prison for five years on
8 February 2018, for her involvement in the Zia Orphanage corruption case.[27]
The sentence was then modified to 10 years.[28] Khaleda Zia's successor as
chair of the party, her son Tarique Rahman, was also found guilty of criminal
conspiracy and multiple counts of murder for a grenade attack in 2004 that
injured Hasina and killed 24 people.[29] He was sentenced to life in prison.
As such, he was barred from running for office.[30]

In order to guarantee that the election will be conducted in accordance with
electoral law and the constitution, the 2024 Bangladesh Election Commission
was formed on 27 February 2022.[31] It is responsible for announcing election
schedules, outlining constituency zones, preparing electoral rolls,
supervising the elections, announcing the election's results, and establishing
election boards to settle any election disputes.[32] It is chaired by Kazi
Habibul Awal, Md. Alamgir, Anisur Rahman, Rashida Sultana Emily and Ahsan
Habib Khan.[33]

In the election, President Mohammed Shahabuddin and first lady Rebecca Sultana
used a postal ballot to cast their vote on 3 January 2024. It is the first
instances of using postal ballot in the history of elections in
Bangladesh.[34]

## Electoral system

[edit]

The 350 members of the Jatiya Sangsad consist of 300 directly elected seats
using first-past-the-post voting in single-member constituencies, and an
additional 50 seats reserved for women. The reserved seats are selected by the
elected constituency members via the single transferable vote. Each parliament
sits for a five-year term.[35]

### Criticism

[edit]

The electoral system has been criticised as disproportional[36][37][38] and a
key driver of political deadlock in the country.[38]

## Pre-electoral statistics and information

[edit]

According to the data released by the Election Commission on 4 January 2024,
the total number of voters in the next parliamentary election is 119,689,289
people. Among them, 60,769,741 are men voters, 58,918,699 are women voters and
849 hijra voters.[39] According to EC, 28 political parties and a total of
1,970 candidates are contesting the election, of which 436 are independent
candidates. Total final polling centres are 42,148 and final polling booths
are 261,564.[40][41]

## Controversies

[edit]

Further information: 2022–2023 Bangladesh protests

The BNP has demanded that there should be a caretaker government during
election season because, as Citizens for Good Governance founder-secretary
Badiul Alam Majumder has claimed, every election in Bangladesh that was not
conducted under a caretaker government has been marred by
irregularities.[42][24] Without a caretaker government, the BNP has stated its
intent to boycott the elections. On 17 May 2023, BNP standing committee member
Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury said: "[Our] movement and elections cannot go
hand in hand. Participating in elections under [the current government] means
to validate them. We cannot continue our movement with those who compete in
the elections when the leaders and activists are being arrested and harassed
while protesting to free the country from this illegal government. Rather, it
is time to identify them and uproot them politically."[43] On 3 June 2023, the
BNP expelled 43 of its leaders for life as a result of their decision to
participate in the Sylhet City Corporation election.[44]

Jamaat-e-Islami was banned from participating in elections in 2013, and many
of its former leaders have gone on to form the Bangladesh Development Party
(BDP), which intends to participate in the elections. The president of the
BDP, Anwarul Islam Chan, has denied any affiliations with the Jamaat, saying:
"The post-liberation generation was born after independence. We are a
political party and not interested in such issues" as opposing Bangladesh's
independence from Pakistan.[45][46]

The Awami League, on the other hand, has insisted that a caretaker government
would be unconstitutional and that the Election Commission is independent and
sanctioned by law.[24][47]

The Bangladeshi Ministry of Foreign Affairs asserted "the electoral process
will remain under strict vigilance, including by international observers as
accredited by the Election Commission."[48] Bangladesh Foreign Minister Dr. AK
Abdul Momen said on 10 April 2023, in a meeting with US Secretary of State
Antony Blinken that the independent election commission is key to holding
fair, transparent elections.[49]

## Foreign positions

[edit]

### United States

[edit]

On 23 May 2023, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced a new visa
policy vis-a-vis Bangladesh to support the country's goal of holding free,
fair, and peaceful national elections. The policy states that the US would
"restrict the issuance of visas for any Bangladeshi individual, believed to be
responsible for, or complicit in, undermining the democratic election process
in Bangladesh", including "current and former Bangladeshi officials, members
of pro-government and opposition political parties, and members of law
enforcement, the judiciary, and security services". The policy lists actions
that would undermine the election process as "vote rigging, voter
intimidation, the use of violence to prevent people from exercising their
right to freedoms of association and peaceful assembly, and the use of
measures designed to prevent political parties, voters, civil society, or the
media from disseminating their views".[50]

The restrictions were meant to act as a signal to the Bangladeshi government
to hold democratic elections and to the BNP to participate in the elections,
as a boycott of them could lead to instability.[51] When asked how the US
would navigate a situation in which a party that refuses to participate in the
national election would later claim that the election was unfair, US State
Department Principal Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel said: "I don't have
anything else to get into, as it's an internal, domestic election" and that
all the US wants is that it should be free, fair, and reflective of the will
of the Bangladeshi people.[52]

On 1 August 2023, US Ambassador Peter Haas announced after meeting with Chief
Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal that a US pre-election monitoring team
consisting of experts with previous experience in election monitoring and
preparation, would arrive in Bangladesh in October before the election which
was subsequently cancelled.[53]

### United Nations

[edit]

On 4 August 2023, the United Nations denounced pre-election violence in
Bangladesh, calling for police "to refrain from excessive use of force amid
recurring violence and mass arrests ahead of general elections". This is a
human rights issue concerning violence erupting at opposition rallies in 2023,
and the harsh response by police using rubber bullets, tear gas and water
cannons. A UN spokesman said: "Police, alongside men in plain clothing, have
been seen using hammers, sticks, bats and iron rods, among other objects, to
beat protesters". He added that hundreds of people who oppose the government
have been arrested before and during the rallies.[54]

UN concerns have arisen after Sheikh Hasina rejected demands by the BNP and
its allies for the government to step down and allow the January election to
be held under a neutral caretaker government. The UN has stressed that
Hasina's government "must abide by their human rights obligations and allow
people to exercise their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of
opinion and expression".[54]

Responding to the UN statement, Mahfuz Anam commented: "From the looks of it,
our two major political parties are preparing for 'gladiatorial' street fights
as a part of their election preparation. Can this be democracy?"[55] Later on
August 4, Information Minister Hasan Mahmud attacked the BNP during a mosquito
eradication conference in Dhaka, saying: "Dengue mosquitoes bite people and
BNP puts people on fire and burns cars. Therefore, like dengue, BNP has to be
prevented".[56]

Soon after Mahfuz Anam spoke, there was a meeting in Dhaka of the 14-party
alliance led by the Awami League. They announced a rally to be held on 7
August before Awami League HQ on Bangabandhu Avenue. The purpose of the rally
is to protest against the "terror and anarchy" of BNP and to "prevent any
conspiracy of the BNP-Jamaat". A spokesman said alliance members will take to
the streets across the whole country, besides Dhaka.[57]

### Others

[edit]

On 7 May 2023, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina urged Commonwealth Secretary-
General Patricia Scotland to send diversified election observers for the
election while stating that her government has made the election commission an
independent and powerful institution to strengthen the democratic process in
the country.[58]

A group of human rights organizations wrote to 14 members of United States
Congress urging them to be aware of how the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami have been
operating "overtly and covertly in cahoots with terrorist groups, like Ansar
al Islam, since 2001".[59]

Terry Isley, a member of an independent election monitoring delegation that
visited Bangladesh in August 2023, said that the demand for a caretaker
government is unconstitutional and illegal in the present political context of
Bangladesh. He also expressed disappointment that the BNP refused to meet with
the delegation.[60]

On 20 September 2023, the Election Commission of Bangladesh received a letter
from the European Union stating that it would not send a full-fledged election
observation mission to the upcoming general election. The letter said
Bangladesh's environment is not suitable for election observation.[61][62]
However, in a letter to the Election Commission on 19 October the EU said it
would send a 4-member technical team to observe the election.[63]

## Foreign observers

[edit]

On 5 January 2024, at a meeting attended by heads of missions from about 90
countries, Bangladesh's Foreign Secretary, Masud Bin Momen, invited foreign
envoys to be part of the international team of observers for its general
elections scheduled for 7 January 2024.[72] A total of 127 observers from
various countries, were present for these polls, including members from the
European Union, The Commonwealth, the South Asia Democratic Forum (SADF), the
US-based  International Republican Institute (IRI), National Democratic
Institute (NDI) and American Global Strategies (AGS); UK-based Conservative
Commonwealth Association and other reputable organizations.[73] [74]

After the vote on 7 January 2024, this election drew mixed reactions among
international observers. Representatives of many international team of
observers acknowledged that this election was conducted free and fairly and
praised the role and efficiency of present Bangladesh Election Commission.
Alexander Barton Gray, CEO of American Global Strategies (AGS) said
"Considering the overall situation, all the observers present here agree that
the 12th National Parliament Election of Bangladesh was held peacefully and
with the participation of the common people".[74] The CEO of the Central
Election Commission of Palestine, Hisam M.Y Kuhail, made remarks during a
media briefing in Dhaka. "The voting process in all the centers that we
visited was very quiet and peaceful," Kuhail said. "The people of your country
should be proud of holding such a peaceful election." When asked about the
voter turnout, Kuhail avoided the question, stating, "We are here to judge the
voting process, whether voters were allowed access to the polls or whether
voting took place systematically.[75]

The governments of the United States of America and Canada had separately
confirmed, through official statements, that they did not deploy any election
observers with their authority to monitor Bangladesh's national elections held
on January 7. Despite that, a group of international observers were present at
their own effort.[76] However, some USA, UK based international team of
observers expressed the views that this election was not free or fair.[77][78]
Local media in Bangladesh reported that the Hasina government lined up their
supporters near polling stations when cameras and foreign election observers
were near and had them disperse immediately afterwards.[10] However, some
election observers did report a peaceful environment at the polling stations
on the day of the elections.[79]

## Violence

[edit]

Election Commission Secretary Jahangir Alam has told that Mostafizur Rahman
Chowdhury's candidacy has been cancelled for violating election norms and for
threatening "law enforcement officials" just before polling officially closed.
He was charged for these types of allegations in past too.[80]
