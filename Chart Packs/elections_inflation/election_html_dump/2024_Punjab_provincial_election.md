Provincial elections were held in the Pakistani province of Punjab on 8
February 2024 to elect a new provincial legislature. On 5 August 2023, the
results of the 2023 digital census were approved by the Council of Common
Interests headed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Therefore, elections have
been delayed for several months, as new delimitations will be published on 14
December 2023, as announced by the Election Commission of Pakistan
(ECP).[2][3] On 2 November 2023, the ECP announced, in agreement with the
President of Pakistan, Arif Alvi, that the elections will be held on 8
February 2024.[4] The election was held concurrently with nationwide general
elections and other provincial elections.

## Background

[edit]

In the 2018 election, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) emerged as the
largest party in the Provincial Assembly of Punjab after 25 independents
joined it. However, the PTI was still 2 seats short of a majority. After the
Pakistan Muslim League (Q) (PML(Q)) agreed to support the PTI, they formed a
coalition government in the province.[5] The Pakistan Muslim League (N)
(PML(N)) emerged as the second largest party and formed the opposition.

During a political crisis in Pakistan after the successful no-confidence
motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan, another motion of no confidence was
filed against Chief Minister Usman Buzdar, as well as against Chaudhry Pervaiz
Elahi and Dost Muhammad Mazari, the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the
Provincial Assembly, respectively. Buzdar resigned before a vote on the motion
of no confidence could be held and as a consequence, an election for a new
Chief Minister was scheduled on 16 April between PML(N)'s Hamza Shahbaz, the
joint candidate of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), and PML(Q)'s
Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi, the joint candidate of his party and PTI. On the day
of the election, 25 PTI MPAs crossed the floor to support Shahbaz, violating
party policy. During the very beginning of the Assembly session on 16 April, a
riot began between PTI and PML-N supporters. PTI MPAs threw ewers at the
Deputy Speaker, as well as slapping him. The police entered the Assembly for
the first time in its history and arrested 3 MPAs.[6] The Deputy Speaker then
presided over the Assembly session in the visitors gallery and declared
Shahbaz the winner by securing 197 votes.[7]

After the floor crossing, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) de-seated
25 dissident PTI MPAs for defection in the light of Article 63-A of the
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on 20 May 2022.[8] Five of
these MPAs were elected on reserved seats (3 for women and 2 for minorities)
and new PTI MPAs were notified on these seats on 7 July.[9]

By-elections were held on 17 July 2022 to elect the remaining 20 members. The
PTI won in a landslide, emerging victorious on 15 of those 20 seats, leading
to the collapse of Chief Minister Hamza Shahbaz's PML-N led coalition
government, as their coalition became 7 seats short of a majority.[10] Elahi
took oath as the Chief Minister of Punjab on 27 July 2022, leading a PTI-
PML(Q) coalition government.

On 12 January 2023, after winning a vote of confidence the night before, Elahi
sent a letter to Governor Baligh Ur Rehman, advising him to dissolve the
Provincial Assembly. Rehman excused himself from the dissolution process and
after 48 hours, the Assembly automatically stood dissolved. Elections must be
conducted within 90 days of the dissolution, meaning by or before 14 April
2023.[11][12]

On 22 January 2023, Mohsin Raza Naqvi took oath as the caretaker Chief
Minister of Punjab. He was nominated by the Election Commission of Pakistan
(ECP) after days of deadlock between the government and the opposition over
who to nominate.[13]

On 10 February 2023, after weeks of no announcement of an election date, the
Lahore High Court (LHC) ordered the ECP to immediately announce the date for
the elections to "ensure that [they] are held not later than ninety days as
per the mandate of the Constitution".[14]

On 20 February 2023, the ECP had still not announced the date for the
election. Therefore, President Arif Alvi decided to unilaterally appoint 9
April 2023 as the election date.[15]

On 1 March 2023, in a 3-2 split verdict, the Supreme Court ruled that
President Alvi's order of appointing an election date was "constitutionally
competent", as the Assembly was dissolved without the order of Governor
Rehman. However, the verdict further stated that due to the delays in the
announcement of the election date, 9 April may not be a feasible election
date. Therefore, the ECP was ordered to immediately propose a date with the
"minimum possible delay" to the President and after consultation, the latter
shall announce a date for the election.[16][17]

As a result of the verdict, on 3 March 2023, the ECP had suggested the dates
of 30 April to 7 May to President Alvi and on the same day, the latter
announced that the provincial election will be held on 30 April 2023.[18]

On 22 March 2023, in violation of the Supreme Court's verdict, the ECP
postponed the provincial election to 8 October 2023, stating that it had
arrived at the conclusion that it could not hold the elections "honestly,
justly, fairly, in a peaceful manner and in a accordance with the Constitution
and law".[19]

On 25 March 2023, Sibtain Khan, the Speaker of the Provincial Assembly of
Punjab, filed a constitutional petition on behalf of the PTI against the ECP's
decision. Additionally, a contempt of court petition was also filed against
the ECP.[20] On 4 April, the Supreme Court ruled that the ECP's decision to
postpone the polls was unconstitutional and itself fixed 14 May 2023 as the
new date for the election.[21]

Despite the orders of the Supreme Court, the ECP had not conducted the
elections on 14 May and had instead petitioned the Supreme Court to review its
4 April decision, claiming that they "[don't] have the authority to give the
date of elections".[22]

### Ban on PTI from contesting as a party

[edit]

On 22 December 2023, the ECP decided against letting the PTI retain its
electoral symbol, arguing that the party had failed to hold intra-party
elections. On 22 December, the PTI approached the Peshawar High Court (PHC)
against the ECP's order and hence, a single-member bench suspended the ECP's
order until 9 January 2024. On 30 December 2023, the ECP filed a review
application within the PHC, and days later, a two-member bench withdrew the
suspension order as it heard the case. However, on 10 January 2024, the two-
member bench had declared the ECP's order to be "illegal, without any lawful
authority, and of no legal effect. On 11 January, the ECP challenged this
ruling in the Supreme Court, and on 13 January, a three-member bench ruled in
favor of the ECP and stripped the PTI of its electoral symbol. As a
consequence of this ruling, the PTI could not allot party tickets to any of
its candidates. Therefore, all candidates of the party will be listed as
independent candidates and each will have a different electoral symbol.[23]

## Schedule

The schedule of the election was announced by the Election Commission of
Pakistan on 15 December 2023.[24]

[edit]

The 371 seats of the Punjab Assembly consist of 297 general seats, whose
members are elected by the first-past-the-post voting system runs through
single-member constituencies. 66 seats are reserved for women and 8 seats are
reserved for non-Muslims. The members on these seats are elected through
proportional representation based on the total number of general seats secured
by each political party.

## Campaign

[edit]

### Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf

[edit]

#### Joining of former PML(Q) MPAs

[edit]

A day after the Assembly was dissolved, the Pakistan Muslim League (Q)
(PML(Q)) Punjab president and outgoing Chief Minister, Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi,
hinted at a possible merger of the PML(Q) with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf
(PTI). As a consequence, the president of the PML(Q) and former Prime
Minister, Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, who is also Elahi's cousin, issued him a
show-cause notice and suspended his party membership. On the other hand, the
office-bearers of the PML(Q)'s electoral college authorized Elahi to take
decisions on behalf of the party, in regards to the potential merger.[25]

On 21 February 2023, after failing in his attempts to merge the PML(Q) with
the PTI, Elahi, along with all other nine former PML(Q) MPAs, joined the
PTI.[26]

#### General campaign

[edit]

The PTI announced that it would start its election campaign on 8 March 2023.
Imran Khan, the former Prime Minister and the Chairman of the PTI, stated that
party workers will start arranging corner meetings and rallies across all
districts of Punjab. Khan also said that he will suggest solutions to problems
caused by the incumbent PDM-led federal government.[27][28]

On 8 March 2023, the PTI attempted to start its campaign by taking out a rally
from Khan's residence at Zaman Park to Data Darbar. However, just prior to the
start of the rally, a ban on public gatherings was imposed in the provincial
capital of Lahore and dozens were taken into police custody for violating the
ban. Due to the increased violence, Khan called off the rally. One PTI worker,
Ali Bilal, also lost his life in the violence, with Khan claiming the Punjab
police had murdered Bilal.[29]

On 12 March 2023, Khan once more announced to hold a rally in Lahore but a ban
on public gatherings by the PTI was again imposed in the city. The PTI was
finally allowed to hold the rally on 13 March 2023 starting from Khan's
residence at Zaman Park to Data Darbar. Moreover, in his address to thousands
of party workers and rally attendees, Khan announced that the party would hold
a grand "power show" at the Minar-e-Pakistan on 19 March.[30][31][32]

On 19 March, the Pakistan Muslim League (Z), a minor political party based in
Bahawalnagar, was merged into the PTI by its president, Ijaz-ul-Haq, the son
of the former President of Pakistan Zia-Ul-Haq.[33]

On 23 March, the Awami Raj Party, a minor political party based in
Muzaffargarh, was merged into the PTI by its chairman and leader Jamshed
Dasti.[34]

On 25 March, after two postponements, the PTI held its public rally at the
Minar-e-Pakistan. Imran Khan had delivered a lengthy speech where he outlined
a 10-point programme which he said would pull Pakistan out of its economic
crisis. This programme included policies such as promoting tourism, expanding
the minerals sector, reintroducing welfare programs, and enlarging the tax
net.[35]

On 20 April, the PTI had finalised a list candidates for most of the 297
constituencies of the Provincial Assembly.[36]

## Notes

[edit]

  1. **^** 66 seats are reserved for women and 8 are reserved for non-Muslims filled through Proportional representation
  2. **^** This is a column that lists the percentage of undecided voters and non-voters in certain polls that publish this data. As some polls do not publish any data whatsoever on undecided voters and non-voters, the columns with survey participants that had a preference when polled are all that is needed to reach 100%. In surveys that do include data on non-voters and undecided voters, a scaling factor is applied to the margin of error and the rest of the data (for example, if the number of undecideds and non-voters equals 20%, each party would have their vote share scaled up by a factor of 100/80 (the formula is 100/(100-UndecidedPercentage)). This is done to keep consistency between the different polls and the different types data they provide.
  3. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ This poll or crosstabulation did not include any data about undecided voters or non-voters and cut them out completely from the published results.
