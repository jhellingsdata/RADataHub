Presidential elections are scheduled to be held in Somaliland on 13 November
2024,[4] the fourth direct presidential elections since 2003. On 24 September
2022 the National Electoral Commission announced that the elections, initially
scheduled for 13 November 2022, had been postponed to July 2023.[5] The House
of Elders voted on 1 October 2022 to postpone the elections by two years
instead of the nine months previously recommended by the National Electoral
Commission, effectively scheduling the election for November 2024.[6]

The resumption of the Las Anod conflict against SSC-Khatumo at the end of
October has raised concerns about the war's potential impact on the electoral
process and regional stability.[7]

## Electoral system

[edit]

According to the constitution of Somaliland, presidential elections are to be
held every five years.[8]

## Candidates

[edit]

Incumbent President Muse Bihi Abdi of Kulmiye is eligible to seek a second and
final term in office, having first been elected in 2017. He was confirmed as
his party's candidate during the party's 2023 convention in Burco.[9] The two
opposition parties of Waddani and the Justice and Welfare Party have also
announced their respective candidates for the presidency. Abdirahman Mohamed
Irro will once again be the candidate for the Waddani party, having also been
the parties candidate in 2017.[10] Faysal Ali Warabe will run as the UCID
candidate for the fourth consecutive time, making him the only person to be a
candidate in all direct presidential elections held in Somaliland since
2003.[11]
