**Mayoral elections** were held in the Turkish province of Ankara as part of
nationwide local elections on 31 March 2024. A total of 26 mayors, one for
each of the 25 districts of Ankara and one for the Ankara Metropolitan
Municipality, were elected.

The results were a landslide victory for the incumbent mayor Mansur Yavaş, the
candidate of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), who was re-
elected with 60.4% of the vote. The Government candidate was Turgut Altınok of
the Justice and Development Party (AK Party), who was the incumbent district
mayor of Keçiören. Altınok, who represented the People's Alliance and was
therefore also the joint candidate of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP),
won a distant 31.7% of the vote, representing a significant swing away from
the governing alliance in Ankara.

The CHP also gained control of the Ankara Metropolitan Municipal Council,
which had previously had a government majority that had curtailed Yavaş's
ability as Mayor to initiate substantial decisions during his first term.

Throughout the province, the CHP won a landslide of 16 of Ankara's 25
districts, including Altınok's district of Keçiören. This represented an
overall increase of 12 from the previous election. The People's Alliance won 8
districts, down from 21. The results were seen as a redefinition of the
traditionally nationalist conservative political landscape of Ankara and an
indicator of a possible presidential bid by Yavaş in 2028.[1]
