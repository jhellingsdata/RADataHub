Parliamentary elections are scheduled to be held in Senegal on 17 November
2024 following the early dissolution of the National Assembly by president
Bassirou Diomaye Faye.[1][2]

## Background

[edit]

On 12 September 2024, President Bassirou Diomaye Faye dissolved the National
Assembly and ordered snap elections for the chamber on 17 November. Faye, who
took office on 2 April, and his prime minister, Ousmane Sonko, had previously
been in conflict with the opposition-controlled legislature and accused the
latter of blocking his proposed reforms and budget.[3]

## Electoral system

[edit]

The 165 members of the National Assembly are elected by two methods; 112 are
elected by either first-past-the-post or party bloc vote in single- or multi-
member constituencies based on the 46 departments, with an additional 15
elected by overseas voters.[4] The other 53 seats are elected from a
nationwide constituency by proportional representation, with seats allocated
initially using the simple quotient, with remaining seats allocated using the
largest remainder method.[5]

## Parties

[edit]

## Electoral violence

[edit]

Several incidents of violence were reported during the election. On 28 October
2024, unidentified persons attacked the headquarters of an opposition party in
Dakar and started a fire. On 30 October, PASTEF said that Ousmane Sonko's
convoy was pelted with stones during a campaign sortie in Koungheul, injuring
the leader of an allied party. In response, opposition MP Fanta Sall said that
armed “strongmen” acting on behalf of PASTEF had attacked opposition
activists.[7]
