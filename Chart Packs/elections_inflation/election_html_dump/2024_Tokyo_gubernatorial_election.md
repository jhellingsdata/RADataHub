The **2024 Tokyo gubernatorial election** took place on 7 July 2024 to elect
the Governor of Tokyo. Incumbent Yuriko Koike was re-elected for a third term,
albeit at a reduced share of the votes compared to her 2016 election and 2020
re-election.[1][2] Shinji Ishimaru, the former Mayor of Akitakata, exceeded
expectations to place second behind Koike.[3] Meanwhile, lawmaker Renhō, who
was endorsed by the main left-wing opposition parties and was widely
considered Koike's main opponent leading up to election day, significantly
underperformed her polling and placed third.[4]

Ishimaru's success has been attributed to his extensive use of social media
platforms for campaigning,[5] winning independents and the youth vote,[6][7]
while Renhō's poor performance has been linked to her collaboration with the
Japanese Communist Party (JCP), resulting in alienation among independent and
moderate voters.[8][9][10]

The election took place simultaneously with by-elections to replace 9 vacant
seats in the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly.

## Background

[edit]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Yuriko_Koike_and_Hiroyuki_Osawa_2023-04-16.jpg/220px-
Yuriko_Koike_and_Hiroyuki_Osawa_2023-04-16.jpg)Incumbent Governor Yuriko Koike
(pictured in April 2023), sought a third consecutive term.

Incumbent Governor Yuriko Koike ran for re-election to a third term, receiving
the endorsement of the Democratic Party For the People and the regional party
Tomin First no Kai, which Koike founded and currently serves as their special
advisor.[11] The Liberal Democratic Party and Komeito, who previously refused
to support Koike in 2016 and 2020, endorsed her at their own initiative.[12]

Koike's main opponent was expected to be lawmaker Renhō, who received the
endorsement of the main left-wing opposition parties; the Constitutional
Democratic Party, the Japanese Communist Party and the Social Democratic
Party.[13] Shinji Ishimaru, the former Mayor of Akitakata, and Toshio
Tamogami, the former Chief of Staff of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force ran
without the support of any major parties.[14] Free Education For All and
Sanseitō instructed its members to vote freely, while Nippon Ishin no Kai and
Reiwa Shinsengumi did not field or endorse a candidate.[15]

Minor candidates included ultranationalist and anti-Korean political activist
Makoto Sakurai, who ran under the Japan First Party,[16] and Atsuhiko
Kurokawa, who was arrested in June 2024 for alleged election interference and
sabotage during a House of Representatives by-election in April 2024, who ran
under the Tsubasa Party.[17][18]

56 candidates filed to run in the election, with nearly half of them belonging
to Takashi Tachibana's NHK Party,[19] the highest number of registered
candidates to date.[20] Media outlets have described the high number of
candidates as being a result of the election becoming known as a forum for
self-promotion and publicity stunts.[21][22]

## Campaign

[edit]

The main issues in the election included declining birth rates,[23][24]
environmental laws,[25] redevelopment of the Meiji Jingu Gaien area,[26] and
the use of projection mapping on the Tokyo Metropolitan Government
Building.[27]

Incumbent Koike utilized her experience to garner support, delivering
occasional speeches throughout Tokyo.[28] Renhō focused on street rallies and
anti-LDP sentiment, typically making two speeches per day.[29] Renhō's
campaign has been noted for its progressivism, advocating for LGBT inclusive
policies, climate action, and intergenerational equity, which appeals to
younger voters.[30][31] Shinji Ishimaru, the 41 year old who previously served
as the Mayor of Akitakata, has used social media to increase his name
recognition, running a populist campaign by advertising himself as a political
outsider.[32] Like Renhō, he utilized street campaigning, but instead moves
from one speech location to another in 30-minute intervals to appeal for
support. His campaign recruited about 5,000 volunteers to spread his
activities through social media; he also has capitalized on anti-LDP
sentiment.[33] Tamogami appealed to conservatives, making speeches in front of
the Defense Ministry building, having a strong stance in support of the
controversial Yasukuni Shrine and being opposed to immigration.[34][33][35]
Although Sanseitō did not endorse Tamogami, its leader Sohei Kamiya campaigned
alongside him.[36]

The four main candidates took part in several forums and debates. A joint
press conference hosted by ANN was held between Koike, Renhō, Ishimaru, and
Tamogami on 19 June.[37] The four participated in a public debate hosted by
Junior Chamber International (JCI) that was held on 24 June.[38]

## Controversies

[edit]

### Poster jacking

[edit]

election boards. Each candidate is allocated one slot to display their poster

The NHK Party led by Takashi Tachibana launched a political stunt named
"Operation Tokyo Gubernatorial Election Poster Display Jacking." Filing dozens
of candidates for the election under their party, Tachibana was able to gain
access to approximately 14,000 campaign posters throughout Tokyo. By donating
to the party, donors were able to put up a poster of their choice in place of
the party's posters. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications
stated that there are no restrictions on the content of campaign posters,
except for false information, content related to other candidates' campaigns,
and content that violates laws. Despite this, experts raised concerns about
the legal loopholes, and an online petition opposing the poster jacking
gathered more than 20,000 signatures.[39][40][41]

of the election boards taken over by the NHK Party's "jacking."

On June 22, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department warned the party about
posters in Shibuya Ward advertising a women-only adult entertainment
establishment, potentially violating the Entertainment and Amusement Business
Act. Tachibana removed the posters in response.[42] Additionally, posters in
the same Ward featured illustrations of deceased actor Haruma Miura, leading
to a protest from his former talent agency, Amuse. The donor responsible for
the posters admitted to putting them up without permission, leading to
Tachibana apologizing and removing the posters.[43][44]

The Tokyo Metropolitan Election Commission received over 1,000 complaints from
residents regarding the posters between June 20 and June 21. Secretary-General
of the LDP Toshimitsu Motegi expressed the need to consider revising the
Public Offices Election Act to address the poster jacking. Komeito leader
Natsuo Yamaguchi, CDP Secretary-General Katsuya Okada, DPFP leader Yuichiro
Tamaki, JCP Secretary-General Akira Koike, as well as Governor of Osaka
Hirofumi Yoshimura expressed similar views.[45][46][47]

### Perennial candidates

[edit]

Perennial candidates Teruki Gotō (_left_) and Yoshiro Nakamatsu (_right_).

The election gained international attention due to the large amount of joke
parties and perennial candidates participating,[48] which included 96-year-old
inventor Yoshiro Nakamatsu, internet comedian 'AI Mayor', Yusuke Kawai, the
self-proclaimed "Joker of Japan" who gained controversy for putting explicit
campaign posters with a fully nude image of a _gyaru_ model, which was later
removed by the Metropolitan Police Department,[49] and a candidate from the
'Poker Party' who advocates for economic and political reforms through the
card game.[50][51] Governor of Tottori Shinji Hirai said in a remark to the
Tottori prefectural assembly that the influx of joke and perennial candidates
in the election showed that “democracy is at risk of collapse.”[48]

In Japan, political broadcasts airs on NHK to provide a platform for all
candidates participating in an election to present their policies and appeal
to voters. Each candidate is given a set amount of time to speak, and the
broadcasts are scheduled at various times to reach a wide audience. In
addition to serious policy discussions, political broadcasts often features
appearances by joke and perennial candidates who use this platform to engage
in unconventional or questionable activities. During one of the broadcasts for
the election, female candidate Airi Uchino was seen stripping in the middle of
her broadcast. A separate candidate was seen yelling at the sign language
interpreter that accompanied him during the broadcast, causing
controversy.[52][53][54]

### Xenophobic comments

[edit]

Makoto Sakurai, the Japan First Party candidate, has long been noted for his
xenophobia, founding the anti-Zainichi Korean organization Zaitokukai in 2007.
During a campaign speech in front of Ikebukuro Station, Sakurai accused a
24-hour Chinese store located near the station of hosting "400 Chinese
mafias," claiming that the Metropolitan Police Department has confirmed the
information, however, this was later denied. In the same campaign speech,
Sakurai further claimed that public safety in Ikebukuro is "being threatened
due to the rise in Chinese immigrants".[55]

### Assassination threats and gaffes

[edit]

Koike and Renhō's campaign headquarters received a series of threatening
letters with death and bomb threats. Both campaigns have filed damage reports
with the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department and the incident is being
investigated on suspicion of intimidation.[56]

  * On June 23, a fax was sent to Renhō's campaign office with the message "I will stab her with a knife and kill her." The fax also contained statements such as "I have obtained sulfuric acid" and "I will plant a bomb and detonate it on June 24th."[57]
  * On June 24, a letter almost identical to the fax sent to the Renhō campaign was sent to the Toshima Ward office of Tomin First no Kai, the local party which endorsed Koike, stating that they had "splashed sulfuric acid" and "planted explosives."[58]

Additionally, a death threat was delivered to the female model behind Kawai's
explicit campaign posters, resulting in Kawai cancelling his planned campaign
speeches and political gaffes.[59]

## Results

[edit]

Toshio_Tamogami_2024-6-30%281%29.jpg)Despite receiving generous media
coverage, Toshio Tamogami only received 3.9% of the popular vote.

An exit poll conducted by NHK was published at the end of voting at 20:00. The
poll showed Koike winning with approximately 40% of the votes, with Ishimaru
unexpectedly placing second with approximately 20% of the votes, followed by
Renhō and Tamogami.[60][61][62] Ishimaru surprised many by securing second
place behind Koike with 1,658,363 votes, capturing 24.3% of the total vote
share. His unexpected success highlighted his growing popularity among
independents and the youth.[63] In contrast, Renhō, initially seen as Koike's
main rival, underperformed with 1,283,262 votes, amounting to 18.8% of the
votes cast.[64][65]

A separate exit poll conducted by the Yomiuri Shimbun and Nippon TV showed 67%
of LDP and 77% of Komeito members voted for Koike, while 59% of CDP and 71% of
JCP members voted for Renhō. In addition, 19% of CDP and 10% of JCP members
voted for Koike, while Ishimaru won over 20% of LDP and 18% of CDP
members.[66] Meanwhile, 36% of independents voted for Ishimaru, 31% for Koike,
and 17% for Renhō.[67]

According to NHK and The Asahi Shimbun exit polls, Ishimaru received support
in the 40% to 20% range among those in their teens and twenties, while Koike
was supported in the upper 20% range, giving Ishimaru a lead of over 10
points. Among voters in their 30s and 40s, both Koike and Ishimaru had support
in the 30% range. However, among those in their 50s, Koike's support reached
the 40% range, and for those over 60, both Koike and Renho saw an increase in
their percentages.[68][69] In the previous election, Koike was the most
popular across all age groups. This time, Ishimaru led among 18- and 19-year-
olds and those in their 20s and 30s, while Koike remained the most popular
among those in their 40s to 70s and over 80.[70]

## Aftermath

[edit]

After the release of the exit poll projecting her victory, Koike made a speech
thanking her supporters for voting for her.[71] Ishimaru, who exceeded
expectations and placed second behind Koike, said in his concession speech
that he is thinking of entering national politics in the future, hinting a
candidacy for the Hiroshima 1st district of the House of Representatives, the
constituency of prime minister Fumio Kishida.[72][73] Renhō said the reason
behind her underperformance in the election was her "lack of ability."
However, she said that she wishes to remain in politics and continue her
career as an opposition politician.[74][75][76]

Some media outlets and politicians such as Takashi Tachibana have suggested
that Yukito Ishimaru, who placed eighth with 96,222 votes, received these
votes primarily because he shares the same surname as Shinji Ishimaru,
resulting in some confused voters voting for Yukito. It is argued that Yukito
would not have achieved this vote count given his low media coverage and lack
of popularity.[77][78]

## Simultaneous by-elections

[edit]

By-elections for the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly were held simultaneously with
the gubernatorial election to fill the vacancies of nine seats.[79]

The results of the by-elections saw Tomin First no Kai winning three seats,
