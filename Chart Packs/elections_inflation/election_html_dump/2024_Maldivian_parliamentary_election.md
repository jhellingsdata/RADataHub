Parliamentary elections were held in the Maldives on 21 April 2024,[1] having
previously been scheduled for 17 March.[2] The election date was changed to
April after President Mohamed Muizzu ratified election postponement bill by
the People's Majlis passed on 28 February.[3][4] Due to Grade 7, 8 and 9 exams
scheduled for 16–27 April clashing with the parliamentary election date, the
Ministry of Education decided to bring forward the tests to 27 March–25
April.[5]

The result was a landslide victory for Muizzu's People's National Congress
(PNC) and a heavy defeat for the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), which won a
similar landslide in the 2019 elections. The results were seen as an
endorsement of Muizzu's plan to press ahead with closer economic cooperation
with China and a rebuke of the pro-India MDP, which had sought to disrupt
efforts to realign Maldivian diplomacy.[6][7]

## Background

[edit]

The election was held amid a dispute between President Mohamed Muizzu and the
outgoing People's Majlis, which blocked several of his initiatives as well as
the appointment of three of his nominated cabinet members.[8]

## Electoral system

[edit]

The 93 seats in the People's Majlis are elected in single-member
constituencies using the first-past-the-post system.[9] Prior to the
elections, the number of seats was increased from 87 to 93, with six new seats
created.[10] In the election, 98 constituencies are being contested by a total
of 368 candidates, while around 284,000 people are eligible to vote.[1]

### Constituencies

[edit]

Seats in the People's Majlis are split in conformity of Article 10 of the
Electoral Constituencies Act which emphasizes stabilization of equal balance
amid representation of parliamentary seats. The Act stipulates that two
representatives must be appointed for a populace of 5000 or fewer in an
administrative division with an additional seat allocated to account for a
population surge of another 5000 constituents.[11]

Consequent to the observation of population increases across several regions
within the last five years, the number of constituencies was increased to 93
with six new constituencies added to the earlier 87 seats in the 19th
parliamentary term.[12][13]

## Campaign

[edit]

The Parliamentary Elections Regulations include a comprehensive code of
conduct aimed at regulating the behavior of candidates and their supporters
during the campaign period. However, concerns were raised over restrictions
imposed by the code on freedom of expression and campaigning.[14]

Despite these concerns, the campaign leading up to the parliamentary elections
was relatively peaceful. The Maldives Police Service indicated that they did
not anticipate any major disruptions, disturbances, or protests either during
the campaign period or on Election Day. However, there were potential risks of
some disturbances, particularly due to the alleged links of several candidates
to gangs.[14]

One key concern was the possibility of disagreements or clashes between
supporters of rival candidates, especially in light of incidents during the
People's National Congress (PNC) and Maldivian Democratic Party primaries. The
Maldives Police Service said they were prepared to handle any such scenarios
that may arise.[14]

### People's National Congress

[edit]

For this election, the PNC entered into a coalition agreement with the
Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM), but solely fielded candidates from the
PNC, contesting to secure all but three seats this term. The constituencies
they had relinquished offered leeway for political leaders of Jumhooree Party
(Qasim Ibrahim vying for the Maamigili seat), Maldives Development Alliance
(MDA)'s Ahmed Siyam running for the Meedhoo Constituency and Maldives National
Party (MNP)'s Mohamed Nazim contesting for the North Maafannu seat, with
Special Advisor to the President, Abdul Raheem Abdulla affirming that these
seats were forfeited in a bid to display respect to these leaders.[15]

## Candidates

[edit]

The People's National Congress had 90 candidates, followed by the Maldivian
Democratic Party with 89 candidates. There were 130 independent candidates
among 93 constituencies and four candidates from the Adhaalath Party and the
Jumhooree Party. Two candidates contested from the Maldives National Party.

Party| Number of Candidates  
---|---  
| Independents| 130  
| People's National Congress| 90  
| Maldivian Democratic Party| 89  
| The Democrats| 39  
| Jumhooree Party| 10  
| Adhaalath Party| 4  
| Maldives Development Alliance| 4  
| Maldives National Party| 2  
Total| 368

## Results

[edit]

Allegations of vote buying and undue influence were made on election
day.[16][17] Initial results suggested that the president's party, the
People's National Congress was on course to win at least 70 seats.[18][19]
Maldivian media described the results as giving a supermajority for the PNC,
with its numbers allowing it to achieve the two-thirds in the People's Majlis
that is required to amend the constitution. The PNC's successes came at the
cost of the MDP, which itself held a supermajority in the outgoing Majlis and
lost its strongholds of Malé, Addu City and Kulhudhuffushi to the PNC.[20]

## Aftermath

[edit]

MDP chair Fayyaz Ismail congratulated the PNC for winning the election but
vowed that it would continue to "hold it accountable as responsible
opposition".[21] Several independent candidates who won in the election later
joined the PNC, pushing its total number of seats to 73.[22][23]

## Reactions

[edit]

The United States Department of State said it was "glad to hear observers
reported no major issues or irregularities, and that the results are
indicative of the will of the people".[24]
