Presidential elections were held in Moldova on 20 October 2024,[2] with a
runoff held on 3 November.[3] Incumbent president Maia Sandu, who won the
first round, and former Prosecutor General Alexandr Stoianoglo, who was the
runner-up, contested the runoff, with Sandu winning a majority of votes and
being re-elected for a second and final term.[4]

_The Guardian_ described the election as a choice between the West and Russia,
with Sandu representing the pro-European side and Stoianoglo the Russian-
friendly side.[5] Renato Usatîi, who finished third in the first round,
declined to back either candidate in the runoff.[6] _Romanian Insider_
described Victoria Furtună and Vasile Tarlev, who came in fifth and sixth as
backed by the pro-Russian oligarch Ilan Shor.[7]

On the same day as the first round of the election, a majority of Moldovans
voted "yes" to add the desire for EU membership to the country's constitution.
This was seen as a victory for Sandu who campaigned for the "yes" side,
although the result was closer than expected, a fact Sandu blamed on alleged
Russian-sponsored interference on the election, including vote buying
organised by Russian-trained groups.[8] OSCE described international observers
as assessing the first round's conduct "overwhelmingly positively", although
OSCE also noted misuse of administrative resources and unbalanced media
coverage in favor of the incumbent.[9] Analysts stated Sandu's runoff victory
was seen as a major relief for the current government, which strongly backed
her candidacy, her push for closer ties with the West, and her support for
Moldova's path toward the European Union.[10]

## Electoral system

### Date

On 17 April 2024, Parliament speaker Igor Grosu announced the holding of the
presidential election in conjunction with the referendum on joining the
European Union (EU) on 20 October.[2] The decision was approved by the
Parliament of Moldova on 16 May.[11][12]

### Eligibility requirements

The Constitution of Moldova (Article 78, Clause 2) defines four conditions
that a presidential candidate must satisfy: Moldovan citizenship, at least 40
years of age, residence in Moldova for at least 10 years, and ability to speak
the state language. Article 80 of the Constitution establishes a term limit:
one individual cannot serve more than 2 terms in a row.[13]

### Procedure

Candidates can be nominated by a political party, an electoral alliance, or
run as independents. They have to collect at least 15,000 voter signatures in
their support from at least half of Moldova's level 2 administrative
territorial units with at least 600 signatures in each of them.[14] The
election results can be considered valid only if the turnout is above or equal
to 33.33%.[15] The candidate who receives an absolute majority of the votes is
elected president. If no candidate receives a majority of the votes, a second
round between the top 2 candidates is held two weeks after the first round.
The candidate with the largest number of votes in the second round then
becomes president.[16]

## Security concerns

Moldovan authorities have accused Russian-trained groups of plotting to
destabilise the election.[17]

In June 2024, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada issued a joint
statement on Russian influence within the Moldovan election.[18][19][20][21]
At the same time, the US also announced sanctions against the Governor of
Gagauzia Evghenia Guțul, who it alleged is an "active facilitator" of Russian-
backed election influence.[22]

In September 2024, incidents of vandalism on the offices of the Supreme Court
of Justice of Moldova and on the public broadcaster Teleradio-Moldova were
attributed to the said groups.[23] In October 2024, authorities announced the
discovery of a plot by exiled pro-Russian oligarch Ilan Shor involving $15
million in funds from Russia that were distributed to around 130,000 people in
order to bribe voters into selecting anti-Western decisions, and spread
disinformation against the European Union on social media, following raids on
26 locations nationwide.[24][25] Russia denied the accusations.[26] Security
checks were strengthened at Chișinău International Airport following an influx
of passengers from Russia carrying large amounts of cash believed to be
connected with the plot.[27]

Later that month, Moldova accused Russia of plotting to bus in voters to
polling stations at the Moldovan Embassy in Moscow. In response, the EU
imposed sanctions on five officials from the autonomous Gagauzia region and on
one Russian-based entity involved in the influence operation.[28] The United
States accused Russia of spending "millions of dollars" to support its
preferred parties and spreading disinformation online.[29][30] The Russian
foreign ministry in turn accused Moldova of printing only 10,000 ballots for
500,000 eligible Moldovans living in Russia.[31]

On 17 October, Moldovan authorities announced the discovery of another plot in
which 100 youths were trained in Moscow, Serbia and Bosnia by private military
groups to foment civil unrest, including using nonlethal weapons to create
"mass disorder" during the election and referendum, adding that four people
had been arrested and that some of them received several thousand euros in
payments.[32]

Olga Roșca, a foreign policy adviser to Sandu, warned that "Russia is pouring
millions in dirty money to hijack our democratic processes. This isn't just
meddling, it's full-blown interference aimed at destabilising our future. And
it is alarming."[5]

The European Union deployed its Cyber Rapid Response Team led by Lithuania to
Moldova in order to oversee cybersecurity concerns in the election and
referendum following a request from the Moldovan Information Technology and
Cyber Security Service.[33]

On 31 October, authorities raided a political party headquarters and accused
12 people of engaging in vote-buying. Forty government employees were also
placed under investigation for selling their votes. On 1 November, Prime
Minister Dorin Recean reported cases of "anonymous death threats via phone
calls" being made on citizens nationwide, which he described as an attempt to
scare voters.[34] On the day of the runoff vote, the CEC said that it had
received reports of organised and illegal transportation of voters to Russia,
Belarus, Azerbaijan and Turkey.[35] Stanislav Secrieru, a national security
adviser to Sandu, wrote on X: "We are seeing massive interference by Russia in
our electoral process," which he warned had a "high potential to distort the
outcome" of the vote.[36]

Moldovan citizens living abroad, mostly those working or studying overseas,
who were eligible to vote faced other security issues at the second round of
voting including false bomb threats at polling stations that temporarily
disrupted voting in multiple cities in Germany and in Liverpool and
Northampton in the United Kingdom.[37][38] After polling stations in Germany,
located in Hamburg, Frankfurt, Kaiserslautern and Berlin were targeted by bomb
threats, the German government, via foreign minister Annalena Baerbock
condemned the "massive, coordinated attempt" to prevent Moldovans abroad
voting, describing bomb threats against Moldovan polling stations in Germany
as "totally unacceptable".[38]

On 6 November, the Russian foreign ministry summoned Moldovan ambassador
Lilian Darius to complain about Moldova barring eight Russian election
observers from entering the country to monitor the election and
referendum.[39]

## Election

### First round

thumbnail.jpg)Voting in a polling station on 20 October

Approximately 2.8 million ballots were issued for the election and the EU
membership referendum. For the first time in Moldova, ballots were featured
not only in Romanian but also in as many as five minority languages. Thus,
2,092,641 ballots were in Romanian, 631,979 in Russian, 3,400 in Gagauz, 991
in Bulgarian, 870 in the Romani language and 115 in Ukrainian. For voters in
the pro-Russian separatist region of Transnistria, 90,000 ballots were issued,
of which 45,000 were in Romanian and the rest in Russian.[40]

For the election and the referendum, 234 polling stations were opened abroad.
The first vote in both was cast by Ludmila Vizdoagă, a woman who at the time
had lived in South Korea for 19 years. She traveled from Seoul to Tokyo to
vote in the polling station for Japan, which was the first to be opened.[40] A
polling station was also set up in Varnița to serve voters from
Transnistria.[41]

Voting was held from 07:00 to 21:00.[41] As of 15:00, the minimum turnout of
33.33% necessary for the validation of the election had been reached with a
turnout of 35.57%.[42]

### Second round

1,988 polling stations were opened throughout Moldova, including 30 that were
utilised for voters living in Transnistria who had to go to Moldovan-held
territory.[35] Promo-LEX observers detected 109 incidents at polling stations
or in their immediate vicinity. These included the presence of electoral
advertising material near polling stations, electoral agitation, the
unjustified presence of unauthorized persons, violations of the secrecy of the
vote, obstruction of access to observers and unjustified interruption of the
vote.[43]

### Campaign

In the presidential debate, Sandu accused Stoianoglo of being a "Trojan horse"
candidate for outside interests wanting control of Moldova.[44] She declared
she will continue her pro-European course, saying, "Joining the European Union
is Moldova's Marshall Plan".[45]

Stoianoglo denied working on behalf of Russia. He claimed that he was in
favour of joining the EU, but boycotted the EU membership referendum, calling
it a "parody". He has also declined to criticize the Kremlin for its invasion
of Ukraine and called for improved relations with Russia. He said; "the level
of Russian interference in Moldova is highly exaggerated", adding that he
would seek a "reset of relations" with Russia.[46]

## Candidates

Between 21 and 31 August, the Central Electoral Commission of Moldova (CEC)
received 23 applications for the registration of initiative groups in support
of 19 candidates, of which 13 applications were accepted.[47] Two of these
initiative groups failed to get their candidate registered into the election.

### Rejected candidates

The following people had their registration as candidates for the election
rejected by the Central Electoral Commission:

  * Igor Munteanu (Coalition for Unity and Welfare[c]), Ambassador to the United States, Canada and Mexico (2010–2015);[56] he had previously gotten his initiative group registered,[57] but the CEC invalidated some of the signatures in his support submitted by his party and he fell short of the minimum number required for his registration as a candidate.[56]
  * Vasile Bolea [ro] (independent), Member of the Moldovan Parliament (2014–present); the CEC rejected his registration as a candidate, arguing that he was backed by the bloc Victory and the party Revival despite having claimed to have disassociated himself from Revival to participate as an independent candidate. Revival is part of the bloc Victory, led by fugitive Moldovan oligarch Ilan Shor. The CEC did not allow Victory to participate in the election.[58]
  * Valeriu Pleșca (European Social Democratic Party), Minister of Defense (2004–2007)[59]
  * Valentin Borodachi (independent)[60]
  * Ludmila Corsun (independent)[61]
  * Avelin Tabarcea (independent)[62][63]

Furthermore, Alexandru Arseni, whose initiative group supporting his candidacy
had been successfully registered, did not submit the necessary documents for
his inscription on the ballot of the election,[64] having previously failed to
obtain the required number of signatures in his support within the required
time frame.[65]

### Declined

The following people were subjects of speculation about their potential
candidacy within the previous months, but they rejected the speculation and
announced they would not run as a candidate:

  * Ion Ceban, Mayor of Chișinău (2019–present)[66]
  * Igor Dodon, President of Moldova (2016–2020)[67][68]
  * Vlad Filat, Prime Minister of Moldova (2009–2013)[69]
  * Teodor Cârnaț, Member of the Superior Council of Magistrates (2013–2017)

## Aftermath

### First round

President Sandu attributed the result of the first round and the referendum to
foreign interference and described it as an "unprecedented assault on
democracy", adding that her government had evidence that 150,000 votes had
been bought, with an objective of 300,000. The European Union also said that
the two exercises had taken place "under unprecedented interference and
intimidation by Russia and its proxies".[130] The United States also noted
Russian attempts to "undermine Moldova's election and its European
integration".[131] The Kremlin, in response, had denounced the votes in
Moldova as "unfree", casting doubt on what it said was a "hard-to-explain"
increase in votes in favor of Sandu and the EU referendum, and challenged her
to "present evidence" of meddling.[132]

#### Instances of vote buying

Four hundred Moldovan citizens were investigated for allegedly receiving money
to choose the "no" option in the referendum and vote for a determined
candidate in the presidential election. Those found guilty would have been
fined 37,000 Moldovan lei (over 1,900 euros), but were given the option of not
receiving punishment if they cooperated with the authorities.[133]

The head of the Moldovan Police, Viorel Cernăuțeanu, stated on 24 October that
since September, a total of $39 million, including 15 million that month and
24 million in October, had been transferred to over 138,000 people in Moldova
through the Russian bank Promsvyazbank, which is banned in Moldova. He added
that the number of people that had benefited from this system would be much
greater as they would have received money not only for themselves but also for
members of their family. This money transfer system was believed to have
started in late spring, and was carried out through applications that people
downloaded with instructions from interactive chatbots on Telegram. This
allowed them to enter the system and benefit from transfers from the bank.
Cernăuțeanu stated that Moldovan police had documented and stopped the
activity of such bots in 97 Telegram groups.[134]

#### International reactions

The OSCE election observation mission wrote that the voting process was
received "overwhelmingly positively" by its observers. According to the
report, "the election administration worked professionally and demonstrated
impartiality in their decision-making", while "fundamental freedoms were
generally respected and contestants could campaign freely". Regarding media
landscape, the report stated that "the majority of ODIHR EOM interlocutors
informed that conditions for media work without interference have improved",
however it also noted misuse of administrative resources by Sandu's campaign
and concluded that media coverage did not provide fully equal opportunities,
with several media organizations, most notably the public broadcaster
Teleradio-Moldova, favouring Sandu and the government. The Electoral
Commission also did not resolve complaints in timely manner, and failed to
properly address allegations of misuse of office by the incumbent. The report
also acknowledged concerns over illicit foreign interference and
disinformation campaigns.[135]

#### Domestic reactions

In a statement on 24 October, Sandu stated that, despite the instances of vote
buying, she had rejected suggestions of annulling and repeating the elections
as "no one has the right to deny citizens a massive, honest and free
expression of their will". She further stated that, without the buying of
votes, "we would have had a clear victory for both the presidential elections
and the referendum", and also urged the Moldovan judiciary to "wake up" and
address the issue of electoral bribery.[136] Former Moldovan Defence Minister
Anatol Salaru said ahead of the run-off, that the result would decide whether
Moldova would "continue the process of European integration or return to the
Russia fold".[6]

### Second round

Sandu declared in her victory speech; "Moldova, you are victorious! Today,
dear Moldovans, you have given a lesson in democracy, worthy of being written
in history books. Today, you have saved Moldova". She went on to announce that
the election had faced an unprecedented attack through alleged schemes
including dirty money, vote-buying, and electoral interference "by hostile
forces from outside the country" and criminal groups. She pledged to be a
"president for all" and concluded: "You have shown that nothing can stand in
the way of the people's power when they choose to speak through their vote".
Her speech was delivered in Romanian and partly in Russian.[10][137]

Speaking before the final vote count, Stoianoglo told the media that
"everyone's voice deserves respect" and that he hopes "from now on, we will
put an end to the hatred and division imposed on us."[10] The Party of
Socialists alleged that voting was marred by irregularities and the reduction
of polling stations available for Moldovans living in Russia. It also called
Sandu an "illegitimate president".[137] PRSM leader Igor Dodon also called
Sandu "a president of the diaspora", citing her strong showing among overseas
voters.[128] Stoianoglo formally conceded on 6 November, while noting that he
had led in the counting within Moldova and describing his loss as "not a final
defeat, it is only a lost battle".[138]

#### International reactions

Marcel Ciolacu, Prime Minister of Romania, congratulated Maia Sandu and said
Moldovans chose to defend their democracy and continue their pro-European
Union path. He declared that Moldovans "reconfirmed in front of the whole
world not only their courage, but also their full confidence in their European
future!" despite Russian attempts at vote-buying.[139] EU foreign policy chief
Josep Borrell and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also
congratulated Sandu, with Von der Leyen saying that "it takes a rare kind of
strength to overcome the challenges you've faced in this election.[37] French
President Emmanuel Macron also praised the result, saying that democracy had
"triumphed over all interference and all maneuvers".[140] Congratulations were
also sent by German chancellor Olaf Scholz and Ukrainian president Volodymyr
Zelenskyy.[137]

In Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov described the election as
"neither democratic nor fair" and refused to recognise Sandu as president,
saying that overseas Moldovan voters in Russia were disenfranchised. The
Russian foreign ministry accused the West of "blatant interference" in the
election and Moldovan authorities of "unprecedented repression against the
opposition".[141]
