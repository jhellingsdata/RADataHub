| **Incumbent Premier**  
Tim Houston  
Progressive Conservative |   
  
  
---|---  
  
The **2024 Nova Scotia general election** will be held on November 26, 2024,
to elect members to the 65th General Assembly of Nova Scotia.

The incumbent Progressive Conservative Association of Nova Scotia (PC)
government, led by Premier Tim Houston since 2021, called a snap election
seeking re-election to a second consecutive term. The PC's primary opponents
are the Nova Scotia Liberal Party led by Zach Churchill and the Nova Scotia
New Democratic Party led by Claudia Chender. Both opposition parties will have
new leadership from the last election.

## Background

[edit]

During the 2021 election, the Progressive Conservatives included a commitment
in their platform to introduce fixed election dates in the province. Under
amendments to the provincial _Elections Act_ introduced and passed in October
2021, the first fixed election date following the 2021 Nova Scotia general
election was set as 15 July 2025 with all subsequent elections to take place
on the third Tuesday in July of the fourth calendar year following the
previous election.[1] However, the general assembly may be dissolved earlier
by order of the lieutenant governor of Nova Scotia on the advice of the
premier.[2]
