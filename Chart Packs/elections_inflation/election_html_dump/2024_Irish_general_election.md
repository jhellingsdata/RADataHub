general election

The **2024 Irish general election** is due to be held on Friday, 29 November
2024 to elect the 34th Dáil, the lower house of the Oireachtas, Ireland's
parliament. It will elect Teachtaí Dála (TDs) across Dáil constituencies of
between 3 and 5 seats.

Under the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2023, there will be 174 TDs at the next
election, an increase of 14 seats from the current Dáil, and an increase in
the number of constituencies from 39 to 43. This will be the largest Dáil in
the history of the state.

The 33rd Dáil must be dissolved by the president at the request of the
Taoiseach no later than 19 February 2025. The incumbent Taoiseach is Simon
Harris, leader of Fine Gael, who is leading a coalition government of Fianna
Fáil, Fine Gael, and the Green Party. He took office as Taoiseach on 9 April
2024, following the resignation of Leo Varadkar. Harris has confirmed that he
will seek a dissolution on 8 November, in the hope of an election on 29
November 2024.

## Constituency revision

[edit]

In August 2023, the Electoral Commission proposed a Dáil size of 174 TDs to be
elected across 43 Dáil constituencies – an increase of 14 TDs and four
constituencies.[1] This was the first review of constituencies carried out by
the Commission established under the Electoral Reform Act 2022, where
previously they had been carried out by a Constituency Commission. This would
be the largest size of the Dáil in the history of the State, surpassing the
previous number of 166 TDs from 1981 to 2016.[2] The Electoral (Amendment) Act
2023 implemented the recommendations of the commission.[3]

The preliminary results of the 2022 census showed a population of over 5.1
million, which required a minimum Dáil size of 171 TDs.[4] The Commission was
required by law to recommend a size of the Dáil of between 171 and 181 TDs.[5]
This range reflects the growth in the population of the state, and the
requirement of Article 16.6.2° of the Constitution of Ireland that there be
one TD elected for no less than every 20,000 of the population and no more
than every 30,000.[6]

## Electoral system

[edit]

Main article: Single transferable vote

Under the system of proportional representation by means of the single
transferable vote (PR-STV), each voter may mark all candidates in order of
preference. The quota is determined at the first count in each constituency by
dividing the number of valid votes by one more than the number of seats
(therefore, the quota is 25% in a three-seat constituency, 20% in a four-seat
constituency, and 16.67% in a five-seat constituency).

Any candidate reaching or exceeding the quota is elected. If fewer candidates
reach the quota than the number of seats to be filled, the last-placed
candidate is removed from the count and the next available preferences on
those ballot papers are redistributed until a candidate is elected. If such a
candidate now has more votes than the quota, their surplus is distributed to
remaining candidates in order of ranking on the ballot papers. This is
repeated until sufficient candidates have passed the quota to fill the
available seats,[7] or where a seat remains to be filled in a constituency and
no candidate is capable of achieving a quota as there is nobody left to
eliminate for a distribution then the highest place candidate without a quota
is deemed elected.

The outgoing Ceann Comhairle (currently Seán Ó Fearghaíl) is due to be
returned automatically, unless he announces to the Dáil that he does not wish
to be a member of the incoming Dáil.[8]

## Date of election

[edit]

The Taoiseach may advise the president to dissolve the Dáil at any time during
the period of the Dáil, which can be refused by the president only where the
Taoiseach has ceased to retain the support of a majority in the Dáil.
Electoral law provides that the "same Dáil shall not continue for a longer
period than five years from the date of its first meeting".[9] When the Dáil
is dissolved, the Clerk of the Dáil must issue a writ of election to the
returning officer for each constituency.[10] The election must take place on a
date set by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage 18 to 25
days (disregarding any excluded day) after the writs have been
issued.[11][12][13]

The 33rd Dáil first met on 20 February 2020, and must be dissolved no later
than 19 February 2025. This means that, per a calculation in _The Irish Times_
, the latest date the election can be held is 22 March 2025.[14][15]

For most of 2024, many pundits believed that an autumn election was likely;
coalition leaders repeatedly said they would like the government to complete
its full term but were open to an early election if the circumstances provided
for it.[16] Polling conducted in October 2024 indicated a majority of the
public supported an early election to be held in November of the same
year.[17]

Following the announcement on 1 October 2024 of the 2025 budget, speculation
began in earnest that an election would be called for November or
December.[18][19] In late October, Taoiseach Simon Harris said that he
expected the election to be held before the end of 2024.[20] On 6 November,
Harris confirmed that he would seek a dissolution of the Dáil on 8 November,
in the hope of setting a polling date of 29 November 2024.[21]

## Vacancies

[edit]

Four TDs were elected to the European Parliament and took office on 16 July,
vacating their seats in the Dáil; a writ to fill the vacancies must be moved
within six months of that date, unless there has been a dissolution of the
Dáil.[22] One TD, Joe Carey, has resigned from the Dáil.[23]

TD  | Constituency  | Party  | Date  | Reason   
---|---|---|---|---  
Barry Cowen | Laois–Offaly |  | Fianna Fáil | 16 July 2024  | Elected to the European Parliament   
Kathleen Funchion | Carlow–Kilkenny |  | Sinn Féin | 16 July 2024  | Elected to the European Parliament   
Michael McNamara | Clare |  | Independent | 16 July 2024  | Elected to the European Parliament

Joe Carey | Clare |  | Fine Gael | 27 August 2024[23] | Resignation due to illness

## Opinion polls

[edit]

On 1 November, Coimisiún na Meán announced the lifting of the reporting
moratorium that had been in place since 1997, and which had prevented election
coverage from 14:00 on the day prior to the election until the close of polls.
However, the agency also advised broadcasters not to report on opinion polls
or exit polls while voting is underway.[54]

Various organisations conduct regular opinion polls to gauge voting
intentions. Results of such polls are displayed in this list.

The date range for these opinion polls is from the previous Irish general
election, held on 8 February 2020, to the next election, which can be held no
later than March 2025.
