Elections to the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly was held in Indian-
administered Jammu and Kashmir from 18 September to 1 October 2024 in 3 phases
to elect its 90 members[a]. The results of the elections were announced on 8
October 2024. The INDIA alliance, consisting of the Jammu and Kashmir National
Conference (JKNC), the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Communist Party
of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)), won a majority of seats in the election, winning
49 of the 90 seats for which elections were held, with the JKNC winning the
highest number of seats.[1] The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the largest
share of the popular vote.[2]

This is the first assembly election in over a decade, and the first since the
territory's special status was revoked, its statehood withdrawn,[3][4] martial
curfew imposed and over 300 political leaders detained or under house arrest
in 2019.[5][6][7] Indian government indefinitely suspended elections, for
stabilizing the conditions in Kashmir Valley due to the decades long ongoing
armed insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir. A Supreme Court plea challenging this
was brought forward by Panthers Party in May 2023.[8][9] In December 2023, the
Supreme Court directed the Election Commission of India to restore the
democratic process by 30 September 2024.[10] The order also upheld the
revocation of article 370 and deemed it to be within the laws set by the
constitution. Foreign diplomats were allowed to observe the election but
foreign journalists were kept out.[11]

JKNC emerged as the single largest party, winning 42 seats in total, while BJP
came second with 29 seats won.[12] The INC won 6 seats, Jammu and Kashmir
People’s Democratic Party (JKPDP) won 3 seats, while CPI(M), Jammu and Kashmir
People's Conference and Aam Aadmi Party won one seat each. 7 seats were won by
independent candidates.[12] After BJP's 25.64% largest share of the popular
vote, JKNC won the second largest share at 23.43%. The INC and JKPDP got
11.97% and 8.87% of the votes respectively, with remaining 30.09% going to
other parties, independents and NOTA (none of the above).[2][13] The JKNC's
Omar Abdullah was sworn in as the union territory's first chief minister on 16
October.

## Background

The previous assembly elections were held in November–December 2014. After the
election, coalition of Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party and
Bharatiya Janata Party formed the state government, with Mufti Mohammad Sayeed
becoming the Chief Minister.[14][15]

Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed died on 7 January 2016.[16] After a brief
period of Governor's rule, Mehbooba Mufti was sworn in as the next Chief
Minister of Jammu and Kashmir.[17]

### Political developments

#### Dissolution of assembly and President's rule

In June 2018, BJP withdrew its support to the PDP-led government[18] and
Governor's rule was subsequently imposed in Jammu and Kashmir.[19] In November
2018, the state assembly was dissolved by Governor of Jammu and Kashmir Satya
Pal Malik.[20] despite the fact that many political parties had written to the
Governor expressing their willingness to form the Government.[21] President's
rule was imposed on 20 December 2018.[22]

#### Revocation of Article 370 and reorganisation of state

In 2019, Article 370 of the Constitution of India, which gave special status
to the disputed Jammu and Kashmir, was abrogated[23] and the Jammu and Kashmir
Reorganisation Act was passed to reconstitute the state of Jammu and Kashmir
into union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh with effect from 31
October 2019.[24] The changes allowed Hindu refugees residing in Jammu who
were displaced from Pakistan following Partition in 1947 to vote in state
elections.[25]

#### Delimitation

In March 2020, a three-member Delimitation Commission was formed, chaired by
retired Justice Ranjana Prakash Desai, for the delimitation of the union
territory of Jammu and Kashmir.[26] The commission published its interim
report in February 2022.[27] The final delimitation report was released on 5
May 2022 under which additional 6 seats were added to Jammu division and 1
seat to Kashmir division. After delimitation, the total seats in the assembly
rose to 114 seats, out of which 24 seats are designated for areas that fall
under Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Out of the remaining 90 seats, 43 seats
are in Jammu division and 47 seats are in the Kashmir division.[28] The final
delimitation report came into force from 20 May 2022.[29]

#### DDC elections

In 2020, DDC elections were held after revocation of special status. People's
Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) secured 110 seats, while BJP was the
single largest party with 75 seats.[30]

#### Supreme Court verdict on abrogation on Article 370

On 11 December 2023, the Supreme Court in its verdict upheld the abrogation of
article 370 as constitutional and ordered the Election Commission of India to
hold legislative assembly elections in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir
before 30 September 2024.[31][32]

#### Reservation for SC/STs

The parliament passed the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill
2023 which provides for reservation of 7 seats for the Scheduled Castes and 9
seats for the Scheduled Tribes.[33][34]

#### Jammu and Kashmir lithium reserves

On 2 May 2024, Ministry of Mines secretary Vivek Bharadwaj announced that an
auction to assign mining rights was planned on priority basis by December
2024.[35] Former minister and JKNPP president Harsh Dev Singh, challenged the
legal premise, upon which the federal government planned to assign mineral
rights valued at US$500 billion (half a trillion dollars).[36] On 29 May 2023,
Harsh Dev,[37] stated that in accordance to Mines and Minerals (Development
and Regulation) Act 1957, only a federated state or union territory government
had the lawful right to hold auctions and assign mining concessions for
minerals found on land.[38] In December 2023, the first attempt to auction
Jammu and Kashmir lithium failed. As the auction only received two bids, as
per legislation a minimum of three bids is required for the auction to be
considered valid.[39][40] In July 2024 a second attempt by the central Indian
government of auction Jammu and Kashmir's lithium failed to receive any
bids.[41]

## Schedule

The schedule of the election was announced by the Election Commission of India
on 16 August 2024.[42][43] The date of counting of votes was postponed from 4
October to 8 October.[44][45]

## Aftermath

The INDIA coalition including the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference, the
Indian National Congress and Communist Party of India (Marxist), secured 49
seats, one more than the 48 seats needed to form a government, with JKNC as
the leading party. President of the JKNC, Farooq Abdullah, stated that Omar
Abdullah will be their nominee for Chief Minister of Jammu and
Kashmir.[89][90] On 8 October, the BJP conceded defeat and congratulated Omar
Abdullah.[91] On 10 October, four independent MLAs pledged to support the
incoming National Conference led government.[92] On 11 October, the Aam Aadmi
Party offered its support to an Omar Abdullah led administration.[93] Omar
Abdullah met with the Lieutenant Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, Manoj Sinha,
on 11 October and sworn in as Chief Minister on 16 October 2024.[94]

## Reactions

### Domestic

On 8 October 2024, senior BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi congratulated Omar
Abdullah on the National Conference's election victory and expressed hope that
the new government would focus on regional development, welfare peace,
prosperity and human rights.[91] Later that day prime minister Narendra Modi
complimented the National Conference in what he described as a "commendable
performance".[95]

### Foreign

#### Pakistan

On 18 September 2024, Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari categorically
rejected the J&K legislative assembly elections in the Indian-administered
Kashmir asserting that the polls were "no substitute for the Kashmiri people’s
right to self-determination".[96] The defense minister of Pakistan Khawaja
Asif stated that there is a high chance the INDIA bloc may come to power and
that the bloc and the country are on the same page when it comes to the
problems of Article 370 and 35A. This attracted a series of controversy with
the BJP leader and Home Minister of India Amit Shah saying "The Congress has
always been hand in glove with anti-national forces." BJP leaders further
accused the INDIA bloc of being anti-nationalist forces and received
endorsements from the Pakistan government.[97][98][99] JKNC leader Farooq
Abdullah reacted to Asif's remarks, saying “I don’t know what Pakistan says. I
am not a Pakistani, I am an Indian citizen.”[100]
