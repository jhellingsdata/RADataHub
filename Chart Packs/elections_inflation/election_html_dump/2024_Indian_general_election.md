General elections were held in India from 19 April to 1 June 2024 in seven
phases, to elect all 543 members of the Lok Sabha.[a] Votes were counted and
the result was declared on 4 June to form the 18th Lok Sabha.[2][3] On 7 June
2024, Prime Minister Narendra Modi confirmed the support of 293 MPs to
Droupadi Murmu, the president of India.[4] This marked Modi's third term as
prime minister and his first time heading a coalition government,[5] with the
Telugu Desam Party of Andhra Pradesh and Janata Dal (United) of Bihar emerging
as two main allies.[6][7][8]

More than 968 million people out of a population of 1.4 billion people were
eligible to vote, equivalent to 70 percent of the total population.[9][10][11]
642 million voters participated in the election; 312 million of these were
women, the highest ever participation by women voters.[12][13] This was the
largest-ever election, surpassing the previous election, and lasted 44 days,
second only to the 1951–52 Indian general election. The legislative assembly
elections in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha, and
Sikkim were held simultaneously with the general election, along with the by-
elections for 25 constituencies in 12 legislative assemblies.

Incumbent prime minister Narendra Modi, who completed a second term, ran for a
third consecutive term. His Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had enjoyed an
absolute majority—a minimum of 272 seats—in the 2014 and 2019 elections. The
primary opposition was the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance
(INDIA), a coalition formed in 2023 by the Indian National Congress (INC) and
many regional parties. The election was criticised for lack of action on hate
speeches by Modi's BJP,[14] reported electronic voting machine (EVM)
malfunctioning,[15][16] and suppression of political opponents of the BJP.[17]

Opinion surveys of mainstream media outlets projected a decisive victory for
the BJP and its coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). However,
the BJP won 240 seats, down from the 303 it had secured in 2019, and lost its
singular majority in the Lok Sabha, although the NDA overall secured 293 of
the house's 543 seats.[18] The INDIA coalition outperformed expectations,
securing 234 seats, 99 of which were won by the Congress, garnering the party
the official opposition status for the first time in 10 years.[19][20][21]
Seven independents and ten candidates from non-aligned parties also won seats
in the Lok Sabha.[22][23][24]

## Background

### Contemporary politics and previous elections

India has a multi-party system with two major parties, namely the Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP) and the Indian National Congress (INC), that dominate
politics at the national level. The BJP has governed the country with Narendra
Modi at the helm since 2014. The tenure of the 17th Lok Sabha was scheduled to
end on 16 June 2024.[25] The previous general election was held in April–May
2019, after which the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by the BJP,
formed the union government, with Modi continuing as Prime Minister.[26] The
Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, comprising 26 opposition
parties, was formed in 2023 to compete against the NDA in the elections.[27]

### Electoral system

Main article: Elections in India

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Chief_Election_Commissioner_announced_the_2024_General_Elections_schedule_for_Lok_Sabha_and_State_Legislative_Assemblies_during_a_press_conference.jpg/220px-
Chief_Election_Commissioner_announced_the_2024_General_Elections_schedule_for_Lok_Sabha_and_State_Legislative_Assemblies_during_a_press_conference.jpg)Chief
Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar announced the schedule for the elections on
16 March 2024.

Article 83 of the Constitution of India requires elections to the Lok Sabha to
be held once every five years.[28] The 543 MPs are elected from single-member
constituencies using first-past-the-post voting.[29] The 104th amendment to
the constitution abolished the two seats that were reserved for the Anglo-
Indian community.[30]

Indian citizens who are 18 years or older, ordinary residents of the polling
area of the constituency and registered to vote (name included in the
electoral rolls), possess a valid voter identification card issued by the
Election Commission of India or equivalent are eligible to vote.[31] People
convicted of electoral or other offenses and prisoners, are barred from
voting.[32] Indians holding foreign citizenship are not eligible to vote in
India. There is no postal or online absentee voting in India; members of the
Indian diaspora are required to travel back to their home constituencies in
order to cast a ballot.[33]

For the 2024 election, 968 million people were eligible to vote, an increase
of about 150 million people from the 2019 election.[34] In Arunachal Pradesh,
a polling station would be set up for the only registered voter in the village
of Malogam, as electoral laws stipulate that voting booths need to be within
two kilometres (1.2 mi) of any settlement.[35][36] A polling station was also
set up inside the Gir Forest in Gujarat to cater for a single voter, a priest
at a Hindu temple.[37] Polling stations were also set up inside a wildlife
sanctuary in Kerala, in a shipping container in Gujarat, and 320 relief camps
hosting nearly 59,000 people displaced during violence in Manipur.[38][39]

In March 2024, the Supreme Court of India rejected a petition by the Congress
party to end the usage of electronic voting machines (EVMs) and revert to
paper ballots and manual counting, which was the system used in elections
until the late 1990s, with the party citing risks of electoral fraud.[40]
Nearly 5.5 million EVMs were utilized in more than one million polling
stations with 15 million election workers and security personnel tasked with
managing the conduct of the election.[41]

For the first time, the Election Commission of India allowed voters with
disabilities and those over the age of 85 to cast ballots from their
homes.[42] In Telangana, voting in some areas was extended by an hour more to
allow voters to come at a more convenient time.[43]

### Planning

Key processes during a Lok Sabha election involved monitoring campaign
expenditure, preventing the circulation of illicit goods, and ensuring
adherence to the Model Code of Conduct. In the final 48 hours before voting,
campaigns are ceased, and measures are implemented to maintain order and
prevent disruptions. On polling day, strict rules are enforced to prevent
undue influence and ensure a secure and free election process. After the
elections, EVMs are sealed and stored under tight security with Booth Level
Officers assisting throughout the process.[44]

to end on 16 June 2024.[48]

## Parties and alliances

Main article: List of political parties in India

The politics of India became increasingly bipolar in the run-up to the 2024
Indian general elections with two major alliances emerging; the incumbent
National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the opposition Indian National
Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA). Six parties recognized as national
parties contested the 2024 Indian general elections: the BJP, the INC,
Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP),
National People's Party (NPP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) with all except the
BSP being a part of one of the two alliances.[52] Apart from the national
parties, regional parties (who are allotted fixed symbols) and other
unrecognized parties and independents contested the election.[53]

### National Democratic Alliance (NDA)

### Other notable parties and alliances

states.[63] On 11 May 2023, Biju Janata Dal leader and then Chief Minister of
Odisha Naveen Patnaik said that his party would go alone for the Lok Sabha
polls in Odisha after talks with the BJP fell through.[64]

## Candidates

Incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi was announced as the prime ministerial
candidate of the NDA.[65][66] The INDIA bloc announced that the alliance will
decide the Prime Minister after the polls.[67][68]

### National Democratic Alliance

Indian general election

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/2024_NDA_Alliance_Lok_Sabha_Seat_Sharing.svg/310px-2024_NDA_Alliance_Lok_Sabha_Seat_Sharing.svg.png)National
Democratic Alliance's seat sharing for the election

The BJP announced its first list of 195 candidates on 2 March 2024[69][70] and
the second list of 72 candidates was published in 13 March,[71] while the
third list of nine candidates was announced on 21 March.[72] The fourth list
of 15 candidates was released on 22 March,[73] followed by the declaration of
fifth list of 111 candidates on 24 March. Ultimately, the twentieth list of
one candidate was released on 10 May.[74]

For the first time since 1996, the BJP did not field candidates in the Kashmir
division, with analysts and opposition politicians attributing it to popular
backlash over the BJP government's revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's autonomy
enshrined under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution in 2019. Despite not
having a formal candidate, BJP maintains a presence in the region through
their support of local parties [75]

### Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance

See also: List of Left Front candidates in the 2024 Indian general election

The Congress released its first list of 39 candidates on 8 March 2024.[76][77]
Eventually, the twenty-eighth list of one candidate was announced on 7
May.[78]

The All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) announced its list of 42 candidates
for the West Bengal parliamentary seats on 10 March.[79] In the Left Front,
the CPI(M) announced its list first list of 44 candidates contesting from 13
different states on 28 March.[80]

## Major election issues

### Unemployment

The issue of unemployment has been a major problem for the Indian economy,
especially affecting the youth.[81][82] Unemployment in India has been at a
45-year old high.[83] According to a 2022 World Bank report, India's youth
unemployment rate stood at 23.2%,[84] whereas the national unemployment
hovered around 7%.[81] In 2023, 42.3% of graduates were unemployed, showing
the lack of job growth needed to accommodate the increasing workforce.[85]

Unemployment took a centre stage in the election campaigns, with the
opposition Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance criticising the
BJP government's handling of the Indian economy for rising inflation,
inequality and unemployment.[86] As a part of its separate youth manifesto,
the Congress-led INDIA bloc promised to fill in the 3 million vacancies in
government jobs and bring in the "Right to Apprenticeship", in which any
diploma and degree holder up to the age of 25 can demand employment for one
year and they will get a one-year salary of ₹100,000 for the term of the
job.[87]

### Ram Mandir consecration ceremony and sectarianism

The BJP prepared a pamphlet for the Ram Mandir Inauguration Programmes to
connect with families across the nation. After the consecration of the Ram
Mandir in Ayodhya, a new era of Hindu nationalistic sentiments have dominated
the political sphere in India.[88][89] Modi kept a long-standing political
pledge of the reconstruction of the Ram Mandir and was seen to have fulfilled
the BJP's manifesto to the nation's Hindu population.[89] The Hindu
nationalist ideology of Modi and the BJP has also garnered substantial support
from Hindu community members.[90][91] At the same time, Bollywood productions
have been released with themes supporting the Modi government's policies and
Hindu nationalist ideologies.[92] In response to such concerns, BJP
spokesperson Mmhonlumo Kikon acknowledged the existence of a "level of threat
perception", but said that the party was trying to change that.[93]

A major controversy was stirred when the opposition Congress Party and its
leaders declined an invitation to the Ram Mandir consecration ceremony, saying
that the event was politicised into a 'BJP-RSS event'.[94] Assam chief
minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that the invitation was an opportunity for
the Congress to 'reduce its sin', and that history would continue to judge it
as 'anti-Hindu'.[95] The four Shankaracharyas also declined attending the
event, stating that the ceremony was politicised as a campaign event at the
half-built temple.[96][97]

During a campaign rally in Rajasthan on 21 April, Narendra Modi accused the
Congress party of prioritizing Muslim access to national wealth and planning
to distribute resources among "those who have more children" and
"infiltrators" once it was in power, which reflected stereotypes about Muslims
reproducing in greater numbers and conspiracy theories pushed by the BJP that
Muslims were planning to outnumber Hindus. Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge
called Modi's remarks a panic-filled "hate speech" and a ploy to divert
attention from the opposition outperforming the BJP during the first phase of
the election, while officials in Rajasthan received complaints from the Azad
Adhikar Sena and a non-profit organisation demanding Modi's arrest and for his
campaign to be suspended.[98][99]

A complaint letter by the _Samvidhan Bacchao Nagrik Abhiyan_ (Save the
Constitution Citizens' Campaign) organisation to the Election Commission of
India, signed by over 17,400 people, alleged that Modi had violated the Model
Code of Conduct and the Representation of the People Act, 1951 by making a
speech "aiming at not only appealing to 'communal feelings' but also
instigating and aggravating hatred in the Hindus against Muslims".[100][101]

### Electoral Bonds

On 15 February 2024, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the Electoral Bond
system of campaign financing that was introduced by the Modi government in
2017 which allowed individuals and companies to donate money to political
parties anonymously and without limits was unconstitutional, saying that the
process allowed donors to assert "influence over policymaking".[102] On 18
March, the court ordered the State Bank of India (SBI) to provide all records
regarding the electoral bonds to the Election Commission of India by 21 March
in order to match electoral donors with their recipients and rejected a plea
by the Confederation of Indian Industry, the Federation of Indian Chambers of
Commerce and Industry, and the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of
India from divulging the identities of donors. Initial reports suggest that
among the leading donors to political parties were some of India's largest
firms such as Vedanta Limited, Bharti Airtel, RPSG Group and Essel Mining. It
also found that the BJP was the recipient of nearly half of all recorded
donations.[103]

In total, the top five political parties in terms of electoral bonds received
are the BJP, which received Rs 6,060.5 crore, the All India Trinamool Congress
(TMC), which received Rs 1,609.5 crore, the Congress Party, with Rs 1,421.8
crore, the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS), which received Rs 1,214.7 crore, and
the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), which received Rs 775.5 crore.[104][105][106] The
biggest buyer of electoral bonds was found to be Santiago Martin, the Tamil
Nadu-based head of the lottery firm Future Gaming and Hotel Services Private
Limited, who bought bonds worth 13.68 billion rupees ($163 million) between
2020 and 2024 and made donations to the TMC, the BJP, and the Dravida Munnetra
Kazhagam (DMK), which rules Tamil Nadu. The biggest single donor to any
political party was Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Limited (MEIL), a
construction firm based in Hyderabad that bought electoral bonds worth over 12
billion rupees ($144 million) between 2019 and 2024 and made donations to the
Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS), the BJP, and the Congress Party, who alternated
in ruling Telangana during that time.[107]

Some politicians from the opposition have termed Electoral Bonds a "scam" and
an "extortion racket".[108][109][110] In response to allegations regarding the
electoral bonds, BJP spokesperson Syed Zafar Islam denied that the party had
done any wrongdoing and said that its electoral bonds were gained "on
merit".[107] However, Indian political observers have reached the conclusion
that either Indian businessmen have been regularly bribing their way out of
trouble, or that the BJP-controlled government has been using government
agencies to extort them. From the data released by the SBI, it was found that
companies gave donations around the time they received major government
contracts. Close to half of the top 30 corporate donors were facing
investigations by government agencies around the time they purchased electoral
bonds.[111][112][113]

## Party campaigns

### Bharatiya Janata Party

Main article: Bharatiya Janata Party campaign for the 2024 Indian general
election

The national executive meeting of the BJP held on 16 and 17 January 2023 saw
the party reaffirm its faith in Prime Minister Narendra Modi and extend the
tenure of BJP national president J. P. Nadda.[114]

Charting out the BJP's strategy for the upcoming polls, Modi said in a speech
to party workers that they should reach out to every section of society,
including the marginalised and minority communities, "without electoral
considerations".[115]

Following the 2023 Legislative Assembly elections, Modi debuted the slogan
"Modi Ki Guarantee" for the 2024 polls.[116] Another slogan used was _Abki
Baar 400 Paar_ (This Time Surpassing 400),[117][118] referring to the party's
goal of winning more than 400 out of 543 seats in the Lok Sabha.[119] Having
been used by the BJP in previous elections, including the 2019 general
election with some changes,[120] election analysts have said that the path for
the BJP to achieve this goal will likely be by winning more seats in the south
of India than in previous elections.[121]

The party held political rallies in multiple states with national leadership
including Modi, BJP President J. P. Nadda and Amit Shah campaigning
actively.[122][123][124]

During a campaign rally, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath
described the election as a contest between "devotees of Ram" and "anti-Ram
forces" and urged voters to select the former. Modi also accused the
opposition of plotting to raze the Ram Mandir temple once they were in
power.[125]

During a campaign rally in Rajasthan on 21 April, Narendra Modi accused the
Congress party of prioritizing Muslim access to national wealth and planning
to distribute resources among "those who have more children" and
"infiltrators" once it was in power, which reflected stereotypes about Muslims
reproducing in greater numbers and conspiracy theories pushed by the BJP that
Muslims were planning to outnumber Hindus. Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge
called Modi's remarks a panic-filled "hate speech" and a ploy to divert
attention from the opposition outperforming the BJP during the first phase of
the election, while officials in Rajasthan received complaints from the Azad
Adhikar Sena and a non-profit organisation demanding Modi's arrest and for his
campaign to be suspended.[98][99] Following Modi's speech, the BJP posted an
animated video on its official Instagram account reiterating Modi's claims and
showing Rahul Gandhi holding a copy of the Congress Party's election manifesto
that morphs into the symbol of the All-India Muslim League. After being
flagged by multiple users, the video was taken down less than 24 hours after
its publication.[126] A similar video posted on X towards voters in Karnataka
was also ordered taken down by the Electoral Commission and led to police
opening cases against senior BJP leaders.[127]

A complaint letter by the _Samvidhan Bacchao Nagrik Abhiyan_ (Save the
Constitution Citizens' Campaign) organisation to the Election Commission of
India, signed by over 17,400 people, alleged that Modi had violated the Model
Code of Conduct and the Representation of the People Act, 1951 by making a
speech "aiming at not only appealing to 'communal feelings' but also
instigating and aggravating hatred in the Hindus against Muslims".[100][101]

On 14 April 2024, the BJP invited foreign diplomats posted in the country as
well as 25 overseas political parties including the Conservative and the
Labour parties of the United Kingdom, the Christian Democratic Union of
Germany (CDU) and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) of Germany and
the Awami League of Bangladesh to observe the party's electoral
campaign.[128][129] This initiative is part of the "Know BJP" campaign, aimed
at external outreach and familiarisation with the election process. As part of
this program, BJP president J. P. Nadda met with envoys from 13
countries.[130][131]

### Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance

The bloc's first joint rally was held in Patna, Bihar on 3 March 2024. The
rally saw, among others, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, party leader
Rahul Gandhi, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, former Bihar
deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav, Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav,
and senior Left leaders Sitaram Yechury and D. Raja. Kharge attacked Kumar for
frequently changing alliances and criticised the BJP for not fulfilling its
promise of jobs and neglecting the country's poor and the majority.[132]

The alliance jointly held a rally at Shivaji Park in Mumbai on 17 March, a day
after the end of Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra. The rally was attended
by Gandhi, SS(UBT) president Uddhav Thackeray, NCP(SP) leader Sharad Pawar,
RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, and DMK leader and Tamil Nadu chief minister M. K.
Stalin, among many others.[133] At the rally, Gandhi said that he was
compelled to launch his yatra due to rising inflation and unemployment in the
nation.[134]

A few days after arrest of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in connection
with the alleged Delhi liquor scam on 22 March,[135] the opposition alliance
held a protest rally against the same in Ramlila Maidan, Delhi on 31 March,
where opposition leaders alleged the corruption case on him and his subsequent
arrest to be a "fabrication with political motives" and a "witch
hunt".[136][137][138] At the rally, named "Loktantra Bachao" (Save Democracy),
amid current events, the opposition tried to frame the election as being
"democracy vs dictatorship".[139]

#### Indian National Congress

election

The Congress campaign was launched from Nagpur at a huge rally in which over 1
million people were expected to have attended on 28 December 2023.[140] This
rally also marked the 138th Congress Foundation Day and was being held to
energise party cadres for the 2024 general election.[141] Party workers from
all over the state were called to join the rally.[141][142]

On 14 January, the party launched its Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra,[143] a sequel to
the Bharat Jodo Yatra held the previous year.[144] The yatra started in
Thoubal, Manipur and ended in Mumbai on 16 March 2024.[143] It covered 6,713
kilometres (4,171 miles) across 14 states.[145]

Rahul Gandhi warned that the whole of India will be on fire if the BJP wins
the 2024 parliamentary elections and changes the Constitution, during an
address at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan.[146][147][148][149]

##### Crowdfunding

The Congress started a crowdfunding campaign known as _Donate for Desh_
(Donate for the Country) ahead of the general elections. It formally launched
the campaign's digital version on 18 December 2023 at a dedicated website. It
claimed to be inspired from Mahatma Gandhi's Tilak Swaraj Fund (1920–21). The
physical version of the campaign, which be done via door-to-door collection
drives, was launched on 28 December.[150][151]

The campaign received ₹1.45 crore (US$170,000) on its first day, with the top
five states in amount of donations being Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar
Pradesh, Delhi, and Karnataka.[152]

By the end of 2023, the campaign received around ₹9 crore (US$1.1 million),
with 30% of the funds being collected from Telangana and Maharashtra
alone.[153]

The campaign had collected about ₹20 crore (US$2.4 million) according to the
party when on 28 January, it rebranded its crowdfunding campaign to _Donate
for Nyay_ (Donate for Justice), in line with Rahul Gandhi's ongoing Bharat
Jodo Nyay Yatra.[154] The ensuing crowdfunding campaign collected four crores
in 4 days.[155]

##### Funding issues

On 16 February 2024, the Congress Party alleged that the Income Tax Department
(IT) ordered the freezing of bank accounts by the Congress Party containing
2.1 billion rupees ($25.3 million) as part of an ongoing legal dispute.[156]
The Congress Party's treasurer Ajay Maken later added that tax authorities
imposed a 2.1-billion rupee ($25 million) lien on 13 February, "virtually
sealed" its bank accounts and confiscated 1.1 billion rupees ($14 million).
The party's leader Rahul Gandhi complained that the restrictions had rendered
the party unable to campaign properly, adding that "Our entire financial
identity has been erased." Gandhi also accused Modi and Home Minister Amit
Shah of conducting a "criminal action" against the party, which the BJP
denied. His mother and former Congress leader Sonia Gandhi also alleged that
the tax issues are "part of the systemic efforts to cripple" the party. An
appeal is currently pending in the Supreme Court.[157]

According to the IT Department's official sources, it has recovered ₹135 crore
from the Congress for breaking the legislation exempting political parties
from paying taxes, rather than freezing the party's bank accounts as the
opposition party had claimed.[158] The party received notices from the IT
department again on 29 March asking it to pay ₹1,823.08 crore (US$218
million). The Congress accused the BJP of engaging in "tax terrorism" and
alleged that the BJP is in serious violation of income-tax laws and that the
IT department should raise a demand of ₹4,617.58 crore (US$553 million) crore
from the BJP for such violations.[159]

#### Communist Party of India (Marxist)

Main article: Communist Party of India (Marxist) campaign for the 2024 Indian
general election

The Communist Party of India (Marxist) began their election campaign in Kerala
after announcing 15 candidates in the state.[160]

#### Rashtriya Janata Dal

The Rashtriya Janata Dal began its campaign with its _Jan Vishwas Yatra_
("People's Trust Yatra") on 20 February 2024. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav
launched the yatra from Muzaffarpur in Bihar. The yatra lasted until 1 March
2024 and covered 33 districts.[161][162] In Siwan on 23 February, Yadav termed
the BJP "a dustbin" which takes in other parties that have become
"garbage".[163][164]

#### Aam Aadmi Party

Further information: Arrest of Arvind Kejriwal

The election period also coincided with investigations by authorities into
state officials belonging to opposition parties, such as Delhi Chief Minister
and Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal, who is under investigation for
alleged corruption in the allocation of liquor licences, and Jharkhand Chief
Minister Hemant Soren, who was arrested in February 2024 for allegedly
facilitating an illegal land sale. The Enforcement Directorate is also
investigating four chief ministers not allied with the BJP on various charges,
while investigations have been closed on former opposition politicians who
have since joined the BJP. Hartosh Singh Bal, a journalist for the current
affairs magazine _The Caravan_ told Agence France-Presse that the move by
government agencies indicated their behavior as "handmaidens of the ruling
party to cow down the political opposition".[156]

Following Kejriwal's arrest on 21 March over the liquor license scam charges,
Delhi's finance minister Atishi Marlena Singh accused the BJP of orchestrating
a "political conspiracy" against Kejriwal.[165] His arrest also led to clashes
between party leaders, supporters and the police on 22 March.[166] Rahul
Gandhi, reacting to Kejriwal's arrest, said that a "scared dictator" wants to
create a "dead democracy", without naming anyone.[167] After he was released
on bail and allowed to vote, Kejriwal urged citizens to vote "vote against
dictatorship".[168] He then returned to prison as part of his bail
conditions.[169]

The BJP-led government has been known to use Enforcement Directorate raids to
target opposition politicians critical of it, with 95% of cases registered
being against opposition leaders.[170][171][172] Since 2014, 25 opposition
leaders facing corruption charges have joined the BJP, with 23 of them having
their inquiries closed or frozen after joining the ruling party.[173] This has
led the Congress Party to compare the trend to a "washing machine" in one of
its campaign videos.[126]

#### Shiv Sena

After an intraparty dispute that led to the splitting of the Shiv Sena party
based in Maharashtra, the Supreme Court of India barred the Shiv Sena (UBT)
faction which joined the I.N.D.I.A. alliance from using the party's historic
bow-and-arrow symbol as its electoral symbol in balloting and awarded it
instead to the Balasahebanchi Shiv Sena wing which joined the NDA. This led
the UBT faction to adopt a torch as its electoral symbol.[174]

### Party manifestos

#### Bharatiya Janata Party

Main article: Bharatiya Janata Party campaign for the 2024 Indian general
election § Manifesto

The BJP proposed a 'GYAN' formula consisting of four segments – Garib (poor),
Yuva (youth), Annadata (farmers) and Nari (women) in its manifesto.[175] The
Bharatiya Janata Party started a campaign to gather public recommendations and
suggestions for the advancement of the State and the country, which will be
incorporated into the party's manifesto titled 'Modi ki guarantee' for the
2024 general elections.[176][177][178][179][180][181][182]

election in the month of March.[189] The manifesto focuses on five major

## Misinformation

Narendra Modi, on 21 April during an election campaign rally in Rajasthan,
falsely claimed that former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh once said "Muslims
have the first right on the country's resources". However, Singh's speech also
mentioned backward communities, including scheduled castes, scheduled tribes,
Other Backward Classes, women, children, and minorities.[202] Modi falsely
claimed that Rahul Gandhi had not named Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani
throughout the elections. Gandhi had mentioned Adani and Ambani about 25
times.[203]

In April 2024, the BBC reported that AI and deepfake videos were allegedly
used by both the BJP and the opposition parties in the 2024 elections.[204]

An alleged doctored video of BJP leader Amit Shah’s speech regarding
reservations in Telangana on April 23 was posted by Telangana Congress on
their social media platform X (formerly Twitter), where Amit Shah was wrongly
shown to be announcing the curtailment of reservations granted to the SC, ST,
& OBC communities.[205] Amit Shah accused the opposition of tampering with his
video, leading to the registration of an FIR and a summons being issued to
Telangana's Chief Minister Revanth Reddy.[206] The police arrested two people,
one from the Congress party, and another from the opposition Aam Aadmi Party
(AAP) in connection with Shah's case.[207] The arrested Congress worker was
associated with its social media unit, and was alleged to have created Shah's
fake video.[208] [209] The Congress Party denied the involvement of its worker
in this case.[210]

In June 2024, _Time_ noted throughout the elections, associates and supporters
of the BJP circulated fake news in order to discredit its opponents and spread
hatred against religious minorities.[211]

### Exit polls

The Election Commission of India banned the publication of all exit polls
starting 48 hours before Phase 1 of the election until the end of Phase 7.
This was intended to prevent exit polls from earlier phases affecting voter
decisions in later phases. The ban ended after the close of Phase 7 voting at
18:30 IST on 1 June 2024.[250]

speech "aiming at not only appealing to 'communal feelings' but also
instigating and aggravating hatred in the Hindus against Muslims".[296][297]

During Phase 6 of voting, Mehbooba Mufti, who is contesting the
Anantnag–Rajouri constituency in Jammu and Kashmir for the Jammu and Kashmir
People's Democratic Party, said several of her party workers were detained by
police to prevent them from voting. In West Bengal, TMC workers blocked the
car of BJP candidate Agnimitra Paul while she was on her way to vote in the
Medinipur constituency.[298] Prashant Jagdev, the BJP candidate for the 2024
Odisha Legislative Assembly election in Begunia, was arrested on suspicion of
vandalising an EVM.[299]

During Phase 7 of voting, a mob looted election material from a polling booth
and dumped it into a pond in Kultali, Jaynagar in West Bengal. Clashes erupted
between BJP and TMC supporters in Sandeshkhali.[300] In Uttar Pradesh, at
least 33 election workers, including security and sanitation staff, died of
heat stroke, along with a voter waiting in line in Ballia.[301] State election
officials subsequently stated that compensation of 1.5 million rupees
($18,000) would be given to the families of the deceased workers.[302] At
least ten election related deaths were also reported in Bihar that day.[303]
In response to the ongoing heatwave, ECI chief Rajiv Kumar said they had
learned a lesson and "should have completed the election at least one month
before".[304]

Instances of EVM malfunctioning and removal of candidates belonging to the
opposition were reported throughout the elections.[305] On 18 April, the
Supreme Court asked the ECI to look into reported EVM malfunctioning in
Kerala.[16] 150 EVMs were replaced in Assam after reported
malfunctioning.[306] In Varanasi, about 33 nominations challenging Narendra
Modi were rejected, of which eight applicants claimed that the process was
rigged in favour of the BJP.[17]

On 4 June, former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel said there was a
discrepancy in EVM numbers while former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh
Yadav accused the administration of carrying out arrests of his party workers
in order to stop them from counting votes.[307]

Following the first round, the BJP won its first seat after Mukesh Dalal, its
candidate for Surat constituency in Gujarat, was elected unopposed following
rejection and withdrawal of other candidates.[313][314] No voting was held in
the constituency, as the ECI had certified the results two weeks prior due to
the absence of rival candidates.[315]

The overall election result was described in several media sources as a
"shock" to Narendra Modi,[316][317] with the BJP falling short of its
expectations of winning 400 seats.[318] Though pre-poll predictions were for
an overwhelming majority for the BJP, the INDIA bloc performed much better
than exit polls had predicted it to,[319] with upset victories in major states
such as Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and West Bengal.[320] The BJP had to rely
on the 28 cumulative seats won by the Andhra Pradesh-based Telugu Desam Party
led by Chandrababu Naidu and the Bihar-based Janata Dal (United) led by Nitish
Kumar in order for the NDA to retain its majority in the Lok
Sabha.[321][322][323]

## Aftermath

See also: Third Modi ministry

Narendra Modi called the NDA's lead "a historical feat in India's history",
while Congress party president Mallikarjun Kharge said the election was a
"moral and political loss" for Modi and a "win for democracy" and the
public.[325] In a speech to his supporters on 4 June, Modi said that the NDA
would form a third consecutive government.[326] Following a meeting with other
members of the NDA on 5 June, Modi was formally endorsed to become prime
minister again.[327] On 7 June, he was selected as leader of the NDA[328] and
was inaugurated as prime minister on 9 June.[329] On 10 June, Modi unveiled
his 71-member cabinet, of which the BJP took 61 portfolios, including foreign
affairs, home affairs, finance and defence, while the Telugu Desam Party and
Janata Dal (United) took two ministries each, with the rest going to other
members of the NDA.[330] The BJP's Om Birla was reelected for a second term as
Speaker of the Lok Sabha on 26 June.[331]

Independent MPs from Sangli and Purnia Vishal Patil and Pappu Yadav, both of
whom are primary members of the Congress party, extended their support to it
after the election, effectively increasing the opposition alliance's tally to
236.[332][333][334] On 8 June, the leadership of the Congress Party
unanimously nominated Rahul Gandhi to become Leader of the Opposition, a
position which had been vacant since 2014.[335] He formally assumed the post
on 25 June.[336]

### Stock markets

The benchmark BSE Sensex and Nifty50 indices hit intraday record highs and the
Indian rupee strengthened after the exit polls were released. However, on the
day results were announced, Indian stock markets crashed.[345] Rahul Gandhi
subsequently called for an investigation, saying that Modi, Amit Shah and
finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had misled investors into buying stocks
before the release of the election results on 4 June in anticipation of a
landslide victory by the BJP.[346]
