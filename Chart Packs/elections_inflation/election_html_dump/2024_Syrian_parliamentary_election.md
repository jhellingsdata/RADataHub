Parliamentary elections were held in Syria on 15 July 2024. The date was set
by a decree issued by President Bashar al-Assad on 11 May 2024.[1] 250 members
were elected to serve a four-year term in the People's Assembly.[1] Syria's
parliamentary elections occur every four years, with the last held in 2020.

## Background

[edit]

The 250-member People's Assembly has been little more than a rubber stamp for
the ruling Ba'ath party since it came to power in a 1963 coup.[2][3][4] Two-
thirds of the seats in the assembly are reserved for the Ba'athists and their
allies in the National Progressive Front, meaning it is impossible for the
Ba'athists to lose an election.[3] However, since the start of the Syrian
Civil War in 2011, elections to the Assembly have been seen as a "barometer of
influence among the ruling elite" namely due to the rise in non-Alawite
members that represent various new groups and militias which have helped prop-
up the Ba'athist regime.[3] As such, Assad instructed the security apparatus
of Syria not to intervene in Ba'athist primaries, to inject new "flavor" to
revitalize the party.[3][2]

The government is also granting reforms as part of a rehabilitation effort
with rebels that surrendered in Daraa, which the newly elected assembly will
draft.[5] In 2018, rebels in Daraa agreed to surrender following a government
offensive. However, anti-government sentiment remained strong in the region as
protestors in Suwayda called for a boycott of the elections.[6][5]

Among the pressing issues of the election was the government's poor handling
of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the flight or fatigue of the country's doctors.
Additionally, the Syrian pound reached new lows against the US dollar,
resulting in food and fuel inflation. The government also cancelled subsidies
while doubling public sector and pension wages. Assad meanwhile is focusing on
parliament being a "national dialogue" for domestic issues to be resolved, and
repairing relations with Turkey in order for the latter to withdraw from their
occupied territories.[7]

## Electoral system

[edit]

The 250 seats of the People's Assembly of Syria are elected through party
block voting in 15 multi-member constituencies. Voters in a riding choose a
list of candidates, and the one with the most votes wins all the seats at
stake in the riding. Each list is made up of a minimum of two-thirds of Ba'ath
Party candidates and half of workers and peasants, so that the total of the
latter is 127 out of the total of 250 elected deputies.

Candidate submissions were accepted between 20 and 26 May.[8] On 29 May the
Supreme Judicial Committee for Elections announced that 11,897 people had
applied to run for the People's Assembly, of whom 9,194 were approved to
run.[9] Candidates were allowed to contest seats in rebel-held areas, although
only voters living in government-held areas were allowed to vote.[10] The
number of candidates who were finally listed in ballot papers for the 250
seats was reduced to 1,516, while the government set up 8,151 polling stations
for the election.[11][12] The Ba'ath party and its allies fielded 185
candidates.[13]

Voting was not held in rebel-occupied northwest Syria, alongside the
ambiguously contended northeast region. Additionally, Syrians abroad were not
allowed to participate in the election.[7]

## Conduct

[edit]

Polling stations opened at 07:00, and were supposed to close at 21:00[14] but
were extended by two hours by the Higher Judicial Committee.[15] The stated
size of the eligible electorate was criticized by the Atlantic Council due to
a lack of maintenance of civil registry adult records.[16]

## Incidents

[edit]

Several polling stations were attacked by demonstrators who also destroyed
ballot boxes while chanting anti-Assad slogans in As-Suwayda Governorate. One
protester was injured after being shot by security forces.[10]

Elections in the governorates of Aleppo, Latakia, Hama and Daraa were canceled
and had to be repeated due to violations relating to some voters voting more
than once.[17][18]

## Results

The results were published on 18 July, with the nationwide turnout for the
election at 38.16%.[19][20] A total of 7,326,844 voters participated out of an
eligible 19,200,325.[21]

The Ba'ath party won 169 seats, while its allies won 16 (three for the Syrian
Social Nationalist Party, two for the Syrian Communist Party (Unified), two
for the Syrian Communist Party (Bakdash), two for the National Covenant Party,
two for the Arab Democratic Union Party, two for the Socialist Unionist Party,
two for the Arab Socialist Union Party, and one for the Democratic Socialist
Unionist Party). The remaining 65 seats were won by independents.[22]

## Aftermath

[edit]

Following the election, President Assad issued a decree appointing former
Communications Minister Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali as Prime Minister of Syria on
14 September.[23] On 23 September 2024, a new Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali
government was formed.

## Reactions

[edit]

Overseas opposition groups in exile described the election as "absurd", saying
that it only represented "the ruling authority".[10] The Kurdish National
Council stated that they consider the election illegitimate, saying that the
"Syrian regime continues to exert its authority by force through these
elections, disregarding UN resolutions aimed at resolving the civil war and
political issues in Syria".[24]

The German ambassador to Syria stated that Germany does not support holding
elections in Syria at the moment, explaining that free and fair elections are
an integral part of resolving the conflict and establishing peace in Syria,
but the conditions were not yet ready and that holding the election at this
time would entrench the status quo of conflict and division. Germany also
reiterated its support of the full implementation of United Nations Security
Council Resolution 2254.[25]
