Snap general elections were held in Kuwait on 4 April 2024 to elect 50 of the
65 members of the National Assembly.[1][2] The election came after the
dissolution of the National Assembly elected in 2023 on 15 February 2024 due
to an MP allegedly insulting Emir Mishal Al-Ahmad.[3] The elections were the
first to be held during Mishal Al-Ahmad's reign and the fourth election held
within four years.

## Electoral system

[edit]

The 50 elected members of the National Assembly were elected from five ten-
seat constituencies by single non-transferable vote.[4] Political parties are
not officially licensed meaning candidates formally run as independents,
although many political groups operate freely as de facto political
parties.[5] All Kuwaiti citizens above the age of 21 have the right to vote.

### Constituencies

[edit]

Main article: Constituencies of the National Assembly of Kuwait

Since 2006 Kuwait has been divided into five multi-member constituencies for
the election of members to the unicameral National Assembly.[6] These five
electoral districts represent 112 residential areas distributed among the six
governorates of Kuwait. Regardless of the amount of electorates, all
constituencies directly elects 10 representatives to the National Assembly,
for a total of 50 elected members out of 65.

Constituency | 2024 Electorate[7] | Seats   
---|---|---  
First | 104,038  | 10   
Second | 95,302  | 10   
Third | 143,693  | 10   
Fourth | 220,932  | 10   
Fifth | 270,768  | 10   
  
## Candidates

[edit]

Any Kuwaiti-born citizen who is 30 years of age on election day, who is able
to read and write in Arabic and has not been convicted of a felony or a crime
involving breach of honor or trust is eligible to run for office. On 22 June
2016 parliament passed a law banning any citizen who had insulted the emir
from running,[8] resulting in several major opposition figures including
Musallam Al-Barrak becoming ineligible candidates. All registered candidates
need to pay a registration fee of fifty Kuwaiti Dinars (about US$162.50).

Registration of candidates took place between 4 and 13 March 2024. A total of
255 candidates registered to contest the elections.[9]

### Female Candidates

[edit]

Fourteen women registered to run in the 2023 election, the lowest since the
2016 election. The only female MP during the 17th session, Jenan Boushehri,
re-ran for office. Eight female candidates ran in the Third Constituency, two
candidates ran in the Second and Fourth constituencies, and only one ran in
the First and Fifth.

### Secularist Blocs

[edit]

Two Kuwait Democratic Forum-affiliated members are running in the current
election. Mohammed Jawhar Hayat in the first constituency and Saud Al-Babtain
in the second constituency.[10]

### Populist Blocs

[edit]

The Popular Action Bloc led by former MP Musallam Al-Barrak announced three
candidates for this election. Basel Al-Bahrani in the first constituency,
Mutib Al-Rathaan of the fourth constituency and Mohammad Al-Dossari in the
fourth constituency.

### Sunni Islamist Blocs

[edit]

Hadas, an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, decided to field four candidates
in four different constituencies. Mohammad Al-Matar replacing Osama Al-Shaheen
in the first constituency. Hamad Almatar and Abdulaziz Al-Saqabi will rerun in
the second and third constituencies respectively. Muaath Al-Duwaila, son of
former MP Mubarak Al-Duwaila, will run in the fourth constituency.[11]

The Islamic Salafi Alliance have four candidates in this election. Three of
these candidates were in the last session, Fahad Al-Masoud of the second
constituency, Hamad Al-Obaid of the third, and Mubarak Al-Tasha of the fourth.
Abdullah Al-Kandari will run in the fifth constituency for the Salafi
Alliance. The salafist group, Thawabit Al-Umma, will have two candidates
running in the elections. Current MP Mohammed Hayef al-Mutairi and the
recently exonerated Bader Al-Dahoum.[12]

### Shia Islamist Blocs

[edit]

The Justice and Peace Alliance, affiliated with the Shirazi Shiite school,
registered two candidates Saleh Ashour in the first constituency and Khalil
Al-Saleh in the second constituency. Taalof, a group that broke off from the
National Islamic Alliance,[_further explanation needed_] have registered three
candidates including two who were in the last session. Their three candidates
are Ahmed Lari of the first constituency, Abdullah Ghandfar of the third
constituency and Hani Shams of the fifth constituency.[13]

## Conduct

[edit]

The election was the second in Kuwait to be held during Ramadan. Polling
opened at 12:00 and closed at midnight. Around 834,000 citizens were eligible
to vote. Sheikh Mishal called for a high turnout, saying that those who
boycott the election were relinquishing their constitutional right.[14]

## Results

[edit]

Results showed that opposition politicians maintained their majority in the
National Assembly, retaining the 29 seats (out of 50) that it had won in the
last election. One female candidate was elected, the same as in the previous
election, while Shia MPs won eight seats, an increase of one. The Islamic
Constitutional Movement, a local branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, saw its
seats decrease from three to one. Eleven MPs lost their bids for reelection.
Analysts said that the election result would mean a continuation of the
political dispute between Sheikh Mishal and parliament, which during its
upcoming term, is expected to rule on the nomination of a crown prince.[15]

The Kuwaiti Information Ministry said that turnout in the election was at
62%.[15]

## Reactions

[edit]

Sheikh Mishal expressed thanks to agencies and officials who were involved in
organizing the election.[16] He and Prime Minister Mohammad Sabah Al-Salem Al-
Sabah also expressed his congratulations to the winners in the
election.[17][18]

Adel Al Asoomi, the Speaker of the Arab Parliament, congratulated Sheikh
Mishal and the Kuwaiti government for the conduct and result of the
election.[19]

On 10 May Sheikh Mishal disbanded the parliament for the second time in 2024,
also announcing he was suspending some articles of the constitution for up to
four years and that he and members of the cabinet would be taking over the
powers of the National Assembly.[20]
