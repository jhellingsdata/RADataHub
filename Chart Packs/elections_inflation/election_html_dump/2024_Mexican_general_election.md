General elections were held in Mexico on 2 June 2024.[3][4] Voters elected a
new president to serve a six-year term, all 500 members of the Chamber of
Deputies, and all 128 members of the Senate of the Republic. These elections
took place concurrently with the 2024 state elections.

Claudia Sheinbaum, a member of the left-wing political party Morena,[5] was
widely regarded by her party as the top contender to succeed President Andrés
Manuel López Obrador and ultimately secured the nomination of the ruling
coalition, Sigamos Haciendo Historia. Xóchitl Gálvez emerged as the
frontrunner of Fuerza y Corazón por México following a surge in popularity due
to criticisms from López Obrador.[6][7] Citizens' Movement, the only national
party without a coalition, nominated Jorge Máynez. This was the first general
election in Mexico's history in which most contenders for the country's
presidency were women.

Sheinbaum won the presidential election by a landslide margin of over 33
points, becoming the first woman and the first person of full Jewish descent
to be elected president of Mexico, as well as the first Jewish woman elected
head of state in Latin America.[8][9] The election saw Sheinbaum receiving the
highest number of votes ever recorded for a candidate in Mexican history,
surpassing López Obrador's record of 30.1 million votes from 2018.[10]
Sheinbaum was officially sworn into office on 1 October 2024.[11]

## Background

[edit]

### Procedure

[edit]

The National Electoral Institute (INE) oversees federal elections in Mexico.
Its responsibilities include organizing election day logistics, producing and
distributing electoral materials, counting votes, and certifying the election
results.[12]

Voters must present their voter ID at polling stations to cast their ballots.
Voters with physical limitations or disabilities and voters in preventive
detention are able to vote in advance, with electoral materials sent to the
voter.[13][14] Mexican citizens residing abroad who maintain their political
rights can vote by registering in the Electoral Roll for Citizens Residing
Abroad and casting their votes at an embassy, electronically, or by mail.[15]

#### Presidential election

[edit]

The president is elected by plurality voting in a single round; there is no
provision for a second run-off round.[16] Article 83 of the Mexican
Constitution limits the president to a single six-year term, called a
_sexenio_ ; no one who has served as president, even on a caretaker basis, is
allowed to run for or serve in the office again.[17] The new president will be
sworn in on 1 October.[18]

#### Legislative elections

[edit]

Main articles: 2024 Mexican Senate election and 2024 Mexican Chamber of
Deputies election

The 500 members of the Chamber of Deputies are elected in two ways: 300 are
elected in single-member constituencies by plurality vote, and the remaining
200 are elected by proportional representation in five multi-member districts,
with seats divided according to Hamilton's method. No party is permitted to
hold more than 300 seats.[19][20] Deputies are elected for three-year terms
and will serve in the 66th Congress.[21]

The 128 members of the Senate are also elected in two ways: 96 are elected in
32 three-seat constituencies based on the country's states and the remaining
32 in a single nationwide constituency by proportional representation.[22] In
the three-seat constituencies, two seats are allocated to the party receiving
the highest number of votes (_mayoría relativa_)[23] and one seat to the party
receiving the second-highest number of votes (_primera minoría_).[24][25][26]
Senators are elected for six-year terms and will serve in the 66th and 67th
Congresses.

### Political parties

[edit]

Seven national political parties are registered with the INE and are eligible
to participate in federal elections: the National Action Party (PAN), the
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), the Party of the Democratic
Revolution (PRD), the Labor Party (PT), the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico
(PVEM), Citizens' Movement (MC) and Morena.[27]

Article 87 of the General Law of Political Parties stipulates that national
political parties can form coalitions for elections by submitting a coalition
agreement to the electoral authority.[28]

Article 94 of the General Law of Political Parties stipulates that national
political parties that do not reach 3% of the popular vote in either the
presidential or legislative elections will lose their registration as a
national political party. This loss of registration means they would no longer
be allowed to participate in federal elections.[28]

### Redistricting

[edit]

In December 2022, the INE redistributed the country's 300 electoral districts,
making this the first election to occur with the new boundaries.[29]

The redistricting process granted the states of Baja California, Coahuila,
Puebla, Querétaro, and Yucatán an additional district, while Nuevo León
received two additional districts. The states of Guerrero, Mexico, Michoacán,
Tamaulipas, and Veracruz each lost one district, and Mexico City lost two.[29]

### List of registered voters

[edit]

On 30 April 2024, the INE announced that there were 98,329,591 registered
voters in Mexico, 187,388 registered voters abroad, 30,391 registered voters
in preventive detention, and 4,002 registered for early voting.[30]

### Result reporting

[edit]

On election day, the INE uses two processes to report results, both strictly
for informational purposes and not official. The Preliminary Electoral Results
Program (PREP) progressively counts votes from tally sheets at polling
stations, digitizing and recording them in an online system after being
delivered to INE district offices. The quick count is a statistical process
that randomly selects a sample of votes to estimate voter turnout and
candidate results, providing a preliminary indication of the election
outcome.[31][32]

The district count is the official process for recording election results.
Tally sheets are manually recorded, and each electoral package is certified at
the 300 district offices across the country, with citizen councils and party
representatives overseeing the process. These packages may be reopened for a
vote recount if necessary. This procedure determines the final election
result, after which a majority certificate is issued, declaring the candidate
with the most votes as the winner.[31]

After the district count, the validation of results and the proclamation of
the "president-elect" become the exclusive responsibilities of the Federal
Electoral Tribunal.

### Political violence

[edit]

Further information: List of politicians killed during the 2024 Mexican
elections

Political violence in Mexico typically escalates during election season, with
candidates often facing threats, abductions, assaults, or assassinations.
While this violence is most common at the municipal level, it can also occur
at the federal level.[33]

During the 2021 elections, 102 politicians were killed, including 36 who were
nominees or candidates for public office.[34]

By January 2024, before the campaigning period started, multiple aspiring
candidates for political office had been killed.[35] The government provided
security guards to around 560 candidates and election officials.[36] Around
27,000 personnel of the Armed Forces and National Guard were deployed to
secure the electoral process.[37] By May 2024, the candidate death toll had
risen to 37.[36]

## Presidential candidates

[edit]

### Sigamos Haciendo Historia

[edit]

Main article: Sigamos Haciendo Historia

Sigamos Haciendo Historia ("Let's Keep Making History") is the left-wing
coalition encompassing the National Regeneration Movement (Morena), the Labor
Party (PT) and the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM).[38][39][40] It is
the successor to Juntos Hacemos Historia.

On 11 June 2023, Juntos Hacemos Historia announced an internal selection
process to select a _de facto_ presidential nominee.[41] The coalition
required that prospective candidates resign from their positions in the
government to stand for the nomination.[42] Marcelo Ebrard, secretary of
foreign affairs, was the first to register as a candidate, followed by Claudia
Sheinbaum, Head of Government of Mexico City. Other candidates included Adán
Augusto López,[43] Gerardo Fernández Noroña, Ricardo Monreal, and Manuel
Velasco.

The coalition's internal process consisted of five opinion polls, with four
polls selected from a list comprising each candidate's two suggested polling
companies.[44] The polls were conducted from 28 August to 4 September. On 6
September 2023, Sheinbaum was declared the winner and was later confirmed as
the prospective nominee.[45][46]

Sigamos Haciendo Historia was officially registered as a coalition at the INE
on 19 November 2023, designating Sheinbaum as the coalition's sole
candidate.[47] Sheinbaum formally registered her candidacy at the INE on 18
February 2024.[48]

Candidate  | %[49]  
---|---  
| **Claudia Sheinbaum** | **39.38**  
| Marcelo Ebrard | 25.80   
| Gerardo Fernández Noroña | 12.2   
| Adán Augusto López | 10.0   
| Manuel Velasco Coello | 7.16   
| Ricardo Monreal | 5.86   
  
**Nominee**

  * Claudia Sheinbaum, Head of Government of Mexico City (2018–2023) and Mayor of Tlalpan (2015–2017)

### Fuerza y Corazón por México

[edit]

Main article: Fuerza y Corazón por México

Fuerza y Corazón por México ("Strength and Heart for Mexico")[50] is the
opposition coalition, a big tent composed of the National Action Party (PAN),
the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and the Party of the Democratic
Revolution (PRD).[51] It stemmed from the political grouping Frente Amplio por
México ("Broad Front for Mexico"), composed of the same parties.

Frente Amplio por México conducted an internal selection process to determine
their _de facto_ presidential nominee. In the initial phase, candidates were
required to secure 150,000 signatures, including a minimum of 1,000 signatures
from 17 out of the nation's 32 states. Four candidates successfully advanced
through this stage: Xóchitl Gálvez, Beatriz Paredes, Santiago Creel, and
Enrique de la Madrid.[52][53]

Polls were used in the internal selection process's subsequent phases. The
first poll, held from 11 to 14 August, intended to identify the top three
candidates. Following that, a second poll was scheduled for 27–30 August,
accounting for 50% of the points required for nomination. The remaining 50%
would be selected by an online poll on 3 September.[54]

In the first poll, Enrique de la Madrid was eliminated. Santiago Creel
resigned on 21 August, just before the second poll, and endorsed Xóchitl
Gálvez. During the second poll, Gálvez defeated Beatriz Paredes by 15 points.
On 31 August, the PRI endorsed Gálvez, effectively removing their candidate,
Paredes, from the campaign.[55] Later that day, the third poll was cancelled,
and Gálvez was confirmed as the likely presidential nominee.[56]

On 20 November 2023, the Frente Amplio por México registered as a coalition
under the name Fuerza y Corazón por México, designating Gálvez as their sole
candidate.[57] She formally registered her candidacy at the INE on 20 February
2024.[58]

Candidate  | First poll[59] | Second poll[60]  
---|---|---  
%  | %   
| **Xóchitl Gálvez** | **38.3** | **57.58**  
| Beatriz Paredes | 26.0  | 42.42   
| Santiago Creel | 20.1  | _Withdrawn_  
| Enrique de la Madrid | 15.6  | _Eliminated_  
  
**Nominee**

  * Xóchitl Gálvez, Senator (2018–2023) and Mayor of Miguel Hidalgo (2015–2018).

### Citizens' Movement

[edit]

On 29 August 2023, Dante Delgado, the party leader of Citizens' Movement,
ruled out joining Fuerza y Corazón por México, instead saying that the party
would nominate its own candidate to contend in the presidential
election.[61][62]

The party's presidential candidate registration period was open from 3 to 12
November. The first person to register was Senator Indira Kempis Martínez, who
had previously declared her intention to run for president. Benjamín Antonio
Russek de Garay, Francisco Javier Rodriguez Espejel, Javier Gerardo Limones
Cerniceros, Lorena Romo Vite, Ana María Moreno Hernández, Ernesto Miguel
Sánchez Ruiz and Samuel García were among the participants in the
race.[63][64][65] On 12 November, Marcelo Ebrard, who had failed to be
selected as the candidate for Sigamos Haciendo Historia, announced he was not
seeking the party's nomination, despite being courted by the party.[66]

On 17 November, the party disqualified seven out of eight candidates, leaving
only Samuel García, the governor of Nuevo León.[67] However, on 2 December,
García suspended his campaign due to a political crisis in his state over the
appointment of an interim governor to replace him.[68] On 9 January 2024,
federal deputy Jorge Máynez was nominated as a substitute for Samuel García,
with García announcing on social media that Máynez would be the party's next
presidential candidate.[69] The next day, Máynez was officially designated as
the party's sole candidate.[70] Máynez formally registered his candidacy at
the INE on 22 February 2024.[71]

**Nominee**

  * Jorge Máynez, federal deputy (2021–2024, 2015–2018) and deputy of the Congress of Zacatecas (2010–2013).

### Independents

[edit]

The registration deadline for individuals wishing to run for president as
independent candidates (i.e. without the backing of a registered party)
expired on 7 September 2023.[72]

To formalize their candidacies, independent presidential hopefuls have to
collect the signatures of voters endorsing them in an amount equal to 1% of
the country's entire electoral roll – a total of over 966,000[73] –
distributed equally across at least 17 of the nation's states, within a period
of 120 days.[74]

A total of 27 individuals informed the INE of their wish to run for the
presidency as independent candidates before the deadline. By 7 September, six
of them had been given permission to begin collecting signatures; the
remaining 21 were given 48 hours to correct shortcomings in the documentation
they had presented.[75] The six green-lighted prospective independent
candidates were Rocío Gabriela González Castañeda, Ulises Ernesto Ruiz Ortiz,
César Enrique Asiain del Castillo, Hugo Eric Flores Cervantes, María Ofelia
Edgar Mares and José Eduardo Verástegui Córdoba.[75] A further three –
Fernando Mauricio Jiménez Chávez, Manuel Antonio Romo Aguirre, and Ignacio
Benavente Torres – were announced on 27 September.[76][77]

At the conclusion of the 120-day deadline, the INE announced that none of the
prospective independent candidates had been successful in collecting the
required number of signatures.[78][79]

## Campaigns

[edit]

The INE established that the campaigning period for president, senators, and
federal deputies would officially begin on 1 March and conclude on 29 May,
three days before the elections.[80] Election silence was observed from 30 May
until the polls closed on 2 June.[81]

### Issues

[edit]

#### Security

[edit]

Polling indicated that crime and violence ranked high on voters' concerns in
the election.[82] During outgoing president Andrés Manuel López Obrador's
term, Mexico experienced one of its bloodiest periods. From 2018 to 2022, the
number of intentional homicides surpassed 30,000, with the peak in 2020 at
36,773 homicides.[83][84] However, since 2020, homicide rates have decreased.
In 2023, homicides fell below 30,000 for the first time since 2018, totaling
29,675.[85] Despite this decrease, the numbers remain higher than any recorded
between 1990 and 2017.[84]

López Obrador tackled this issue by endorsing the "hugs, not bullets" slogan
and establishing the civilian-led National Guard. Some have raised the
suspicions that López Obrador's administration is underreporting intentional
homicides, with some cases possibly being reclassified as having undetermined
intentions in order to bring the figure down.[86]

Xóchitl Gálvez highlighted that security would be a top priority in her
government. She expressed her opposition to López Obrador's "hugs, not
bullets" approach and proposed a number of measures to strengthen state police
forces across the country, including raising their salaries to MXN $20,000 per
month, building a university for aspiring police officers, and providing state
governments with increased economic resources and advanced technology to
combat crime.[87] Gálvez also suggested doubling the numbers of prosecutors
and judges and the size of the National Guard;[88] redirecting the Secretariat
of National Defense's (SEDENA) focus from public works back to national
security; vowing to work closely with the United States in order to confront
the drug cartels;[89] and to construct a new maximum security prison.[90]

Claudia Sheinbaum has expressed her commitment to replicating her success as
Head of Government of Mexico City, where, in 2023, her policies brought down
intentional homicides to their lowest level since 1989.[91] She explained that
she would follow a similar structure, emphasizing zero impunity by
strengthening coordination among the National Guard, state police forces, and
prosecutors, as well as improving intelligence and investigative services. She
also announced plans to strengthen the National Guard's capabilities, allowing
them to increase their duties in highway monitoring and as first responders.
She also stressed the role of the judicial branch in bringing criminals to
justice, advocating that judges be chosen by popular vote and establishing a
disciplinary court to punish corrupt judges.[90][92]

#### Social programs

[edit]

President López Obrador implemented various social programs, with the largest
being the Pension for the Well-being of Older People (_Pensión para el
Bienestar de las Personas Adultas Mayores_), targeting individuals aged 65 and
above.[93][94] These programs are very popular among voters.[95]

Both Xóchitl Gálvez and Claudia Sheinbaum expressed their support for the
social programs established by the outgoing administration and pledged not to
abolish them. Gálvez proposed reducing the age eligibility for the Pension for
the Well-being of Older People from 65 to 60.[96] Sheinbaum pledged to ensure
that any increases to the pensions from all social programs will always be
above the inflation rate.[92]

Sheinbaum has proposed two new social programs: one aimed at students from
preschool to secondary education,[97] and the other targeting women aged 60 to
64, where they would receive half the amount provided by the Pension for the
Well-being of Older People.[92]

#### Energy

[edit]

López Obrador has pursued an energy sovereignty policy, seeking to prevent
Pemex from exporting crude oil and instead refining it in Mexico. To this end,
he inaugurated a new refinery in Paraíso, Tabasco, cancelled oil auctions,
financed Pemex's debts, and used regulatory agencies to keep private firms off
the market.[98]

Claudia Sheinbaum is committed to following López Obrador's approach,
believing that the country's energy policy should have a low rate of energy
imports.[99] She has claimed to have a commitment to diversifying Mexico's
energy matrix, particularly with renewable energies.

Xóchitl Gálvez advocated for a more free-market model approach to Mexico's
energy sector, proposing significant reforms to Pemex by opening it up to
private investment and reinstating oil auctions and joint ventures, using
Petrobras as an example.[100] She stated that she would use the oil drilled by
private companies for the petrochemical industry and would produce electricity
with renewable energies.[101] Additionally, Gálvez emphasized the role of
natural gas as a transitional fuel and intended to increase investments in
hydrogen and solar power.[102]

#### Electoral reform

[edit]

During his term, president López Obrador unsuccessfully attempted to pass
electoral reforms multiple times. His latest proposal, unveiled on 5 February
2024 as one of twenty proposed constitutional reforms, aims to restructure the
INE by reducing the number of counselers and requiring that electoral judges
be elected by popular vote. Additionally, it would eliminate all seats
allocated by proportional representation, reducing the Chamber of Deputies
from 500 to 300 seats and the Senate from 128 to 64 seats.[103]

Members of _Fuerza y Corazón por México_ have been critical of López Obrador's
efforts to reform the electoral system and have successfully blocked previous
attempts in the legislature, deeming them undemocratic. On 18 February 2024,
the coalition organized nationwide protests, dubbed the "march for democracy",
in multiple cities, with the largest one occurring at the Zócalo in Mexico
City. Government figures estimate turnout at 90,000; however, organizers claim
that about 700,000 attendees were at the protests.[104] Gálvez lauded the
protests, asserting that Mexico's institutions would remain free from
interference by authoritative figures.[105]

Sheinbaum suggested passing López Obrador's electoral reform if the outgoing
administration failed to do so, supporting reducing the INE's costs, the
elimination of seats allocated by proportional representation,[106] and
advocating for counselers and electoral judges to be elected via popular
vote.[107] Additionally, she proposed a constitutional amendment to prevent
reelection for any popularly elected position. Furthermore, she announced her
willingness to subject herself to a recall election, mirroring López Obrador
in 2022.[108]

### Debates

[edit]

Prior to the campaigning period, the INE set the date and venue for the three
presidential debates.[109] According to electoral law, presidential candidates
are required to take part in a minimum of two debates.[110] Moderators were
selected 30 days before the debate date. All debates took place in Mexico City
and were broadcast on the INE's official YouTube channel, INETV.[111]

#### First debate

[edit]

The first debate was held on 7 April 2024 at the INE's headquarters. The theme
of the debate was "the society we want", with questions focused on health and
education, corruption and governmental transparency, discrimination against
vulnerable groups, and violence against women.[111] On 6 March, the INE
selected journalists Denise Maerker and Manuel López San Martín as moderators
of the debate.[115] The debate was the first in 18 years without López
Obrador, who participated in the presidential debates during the 2006, 2012,
and 2018 elections.[116]

The debate was characterized as light on proposals, with frequent personal
attacks being prevalent.[117] Gálvez was described as attempting to attack
Sheinbaum whenever she had the opportunity to do so in order to provoke her
opponent,[118] interlacing attacks with incidents where Sheinbaum was
involved, such as the collapse of the Colegio Rébsamen during the 2017 Mexico
City earthquake, the Mexico City Metro overpass collapse, and the COVID-19
pandemic in Mexico City. Gálvez called Sheinbaum the cold and heartless "ice
lady" and at one point stated, "You're no AMLO. You don't even have his
charisma".[119] Máynez accused Sheinbaum and Gálvez of belonging to the "old
politics", and highlighted that Gálvez was endorsed by the "worst PRI in
history".[119] Sheinbaum also briefly mentioned the 2024 raid on the Mexican
embassy in Ecuador and praised diplomatic staff there for their courage during
the incident.[120]

Many stated that there was no clear winner and that the debate would not
influence polling.[121][122] However, some highlighted Sheinbaum's calm and
disciplined demeanor throughout the debate, even amid provocations from
Gálvez.[122] Máynez was described as struggling to find footing, since he was
overshadowed by the two better-known candidates.[123] López Obrador stated
that "the whole narrative of the debate was to not recognize anything" done
under his administration, while sources from his government said that the
president was dissatisfied with Sheinbaum for not adequately defending his
policies.[124]

#### Second debate

[edit]

The second debate was held on 28 April 2024 at Estudios Churubusco. The theme
was "the route to the development of Mexico", addressing topics including
economic growth, employment, inflation, infrastructure, poverty, climate
change, and sustainable development. To ensure state inclusivity, the INE
gathered questions from citizens of all 32 federal entities.[111] On 28 March,
the INE selected journalists Adriana Pérez Cañedo and Alejandro Cacho as
moderators of the debate.[125] The debate was the most watched in Mexican
history, with 16.18 million viewers.[126]

Similar to the first debate, Gálvez was again described as the aggressor, even
holding placards several times while Sheinbaum spoke, prompting moderator
Pérez Cañedo to reprimand her.[127] Gálvez questioned Sheinbaum about
investigating potential corruption within López Obrador's administration,
including allegations involving one of the president's sons and the illicit
enrichment of Rocío Nahle García, to which Sheinbaum challenged her to file a
complaint.[128] Throughout the debate, Sheinbaum avoided addressing Gálvez by
name, referring to her instead as the "candidate of the PRIAN" and the
"corrupt one"; in retaliation, Gálvez called her the "candidate of lies" and
the "narco-candidate".[129] Máynez was mostly ignored by the other candidates,
which allowed him to flesh out proposals, with periodic attacks on
Gálvez.[130] Some praise was also drawn to López Obrador's social programs,
with Sheinbaum and Gálvez agreeing to maintain them.[131]

Many stated that the debate would not influence polling as there was no clear
consensus on a winner. It was described that on social media, opinions on the
winner were very closely linked to the opinions on the candidates prior to the
debate.[132] In Google Trends, Máynez led in average interest during the
debate, although there were moments when Sheinbaum had higher peaks than
Máynez.[133]

#### Third debate

[edit]

The third and final debate was held on 19 May 2024, held at UNAM's _Centro
Cultural Universitario Tlatelolco_. The theme was "democracy and government:
constructive dialogues", with questions focused on social policy; insecurity
and organized crime; migration and foreign policy; and democracy, pluralism,
and division of powers. On 18 April 2024, the INE selected journalists Luisa
Cantú Ríos, Elena Arcila, and Javier Solórzano Zinser as moderators of the
debate, each respectively representing the northern, southern, and central
regions of Mexico.[134] The debate's format would have initially allowed
candidates to directly engage with each other,[111] but on 9 May, the
campaigns agreed to a new format where candidates would submit questions to
the moderators, who would then choose and ask them.[135]

The debate saw Claudia Sheinbaum defend López Obrador's security policy and
pledging to continue tackling the Mexican drug war from a social angle, while
Xóchitl Gálvez said that "Hugs for criminals are over" in reference to López
Obrador's slogan "Hugs, not bullets" and pledged to strengthen the National
Guard created by López Obrador as well as state and local police forces. Jorge
Álvarez Máynez focused on youth empowerment during the debate and pledged to
implement a five-day workweek and create more spaces in public
universities.[136]

Many commentators criticized the debate's format and the removal of the face-
to-face portion, arguing that it hindered meaningful dialogue.[137] Opinions
on the winner varied, with some finding it unclear and others declaring
Sheinbaum the victor, claiming that Sheinbaum won because Gálvez had lost, as
she spent too much time attacking Sheinbaum instead of presenting her own
proposals.[137][138] Most polls indicated that Sheinbaum was perceived as the
winner.[139][140]

## Incidents

[edit]

### Gaffes

[edit]

In April 2024, Xóchitl Gálvez stated that people who did not own a house by
the age of 60 were poor money managers, before later clarifying that the words
were meant solely at Claudia Sheinbaum, who lives in a rented apartment and
had attacked Gálvez for the circumstances in which she acquired her home.[141]
Jorge Máynez also sparked outrage and apologized after posting a video in
which he appeared to be drinking while criticizing electoral officials.[142]

On 10 May 2024, Claudia Sheinbaum said during a campaign speech in Baja
California Sur that "we are not going to reach the presidency like Andrés
Manuel López Obrador did, out of personal ambition". Sheinbaum subsequently
said that the phrase "could be misinterpreted" after being advised by the
colleague, saying that she meant to say that López Obrador "transformed our
country without personal ambitions". Xóchitl Gálvez said that the incident
showed a Freudian slip on Sheinbaum's part.[142]

### Disasters

[edit]

Main article: San Pedro Garza García stage collapse

On 22 May, a stage being used by Jorge Álvarez Máynez for a campaign rally was
toppled by strong winds in San Pedro Garza García, Nuevo León, killing nine
people including a child, and injuring 121 others. Máynez, who managed to
escape, suspended his upcoming campaign events and met with hospitalized
victims. Condolences were issued by his rivals and President López Obrador
over the incident, while Claudia Sheinbaum cancelled an event in neighboring
Monterrey scheduled the next day in solidarity with the victims of the
disaster.[143]

### Election day violence

[edit]

On 1 June, authorities ordered the suspension of voting in the municipalities
of Pantelhó and Chicomuselo in Chiapas, citing the burning of election papers
in the former by unknown individuals on 31 May and threats against poll
workers by gang members.[147] On election day, two people were killed in
shootings at polling stations at Coyomeapan and Tlanalapan in Puebla.[148]

## Results

[edit]

![A person receives electoral ink on her thumb after casting her

ink on her thumb after casting her vote.

About 60 million votes were cast in each election, with most of them being
cast on election day. The election saw a lower turnout than the 2012 and 2018
presidential elections, at 61.05%.[149] Claudia Sheinbaum received 35.9
million votes, surpassing López Obrador's 2018 record of 30.1 million votes
and making her the candidate who has received the most votes in Mexican
history.[10] She also achieved the highest vote percentage of any candidate
since 1982.

Sheinbaum carried 31 out of 32 states, with Aguascalientes being the only
state where a plurality voted for Xóchitl Gálvez.[150] Sheinbaum managed to
flip Guanajuato – the home state of former president Vicente Fox – and a state
considered a bastion for the National Action Party since 2000; it was the only
state that did not vote for López Obrador in 2018.[151]

Other than Aguascalientes, Gálvez placed second in all states except Campeche,
where Jorge Máynez defeated her by five and a half points.[152] She also
obtained 5.4 million fewer votes than the combined total of both Ricardo Anaya
and José Antonio Meade, the PAN and PRI nominees for president in 2018
respectively; Gálvez obtained 16.5 million in total, while Anaya and Meade
obtained 21.9 million votes combined.[153]

Máynez's performance in the election marked the best result for Citizens'
Movement in its history. The party received 5.2 million more votes compared to
2018, when it received about 1 million votes – about a 500% increase.
Citizens' Movement secured the third-highest number of votes among all parties
in the election, behind Morena and the PAN.[154][155]

## Aftermath

[edit]

### Election night

[edit]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Claudia_Sheinbaum_discurso_de_la_victoria.jpg/220px-
Claudia_Sheinbaum_discurso_de_la_victoria.jpg)Claudia Sheinbaum during her
victory speech at the Zócalo.

At 11:50 PM CST on 2 June, the INE's president, Guadalupe Taddei, declared
that according to the INE's Quick Count, the winner of the presidential
contest was Claudia Sheinbaum.[156] The Quick Count also projected that
Sigamos Haciendo Historia would keep its control of the Congress of the Union,
with a supermajority in the Chamber of Deputies and a probable supermajority
in the Senate.[156]

Shortly after the INE's announcement, Xóchitl Gálvez and Jorge Máynez called
Sheinbaum to congratulate her on her victory.[157] During their respective
press conferences, both Gálvez and Máynez publicly conceded, with Máynez
highlighting that the results represented the best performance for Citizens'
Movement.[158][159] However, Gálvez later described the electoral campaign as
an "unequal competition against the entire state apparatus dedicated to
favouring its candidate", adding that she would challenge the result.[160]

Reacting to the result on X, Sheinbaum said that she would not let the
electorate down.[161] She later addressed her supporters at the Zócalo in
Mexico City, who had gathered at the plaza to celebrate her victory.[162]
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador described Sheinbaum's victory as
historic and reiterated his pledge not to interfere in her incoming
administration.[163]

### Final vote counts and certification

Obrador showing Sheinbaum's margin of victory in one of his _mañaneras_ , 25
July 2024.

The district count started on 5 June at 8:00 CST. The INE announced it would
recount ballots from 60% of the polling stations, a decrease from the 75% that
were recounted during the 2018 elections.[164] Xóchitl Gálvez requested for
80% of the ballots to be recounted, asserting there were irregularities at
some polling stations.[165]

On 6 June, the district count concluded for the presidential election,
increasing Sheinbaum's margin of victory by 0.85%.[166] On 9 June,
constituency seats and final vote count results for each district were
released by the INE.[167] Projections using the final vote counts to calculate
party-list deputies and senators confirmed a supermajority in the Chamber of
Deputies but not in the Senate, falling three seats short of the two-thirds
majority needed to change the Constitution.[167][168]

On 15 August, after all challenges to the presidential election were resolved,
Sheinbaum's victory was officially certified, and she received the certificate
designating her as president-elect.[169][170]

On 21 August, the INE's Commission on Prerogatives and Political Parties
unanimously approved a draft assigning party-list deputies and senators.[171]

### Party registrations

[edit]

On 10 June, for the first time in the party's three-decade-long history, the
INE notified the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) that it had failed
to meet the required 3% of the popular vote to keep its registration as a
national political party.[172] On 19 June, an auditor was chosen to oversee
the liquidation of the party,[173] and on 19 September, the INE declared that
the PRD had lost its registration.[174]

### Lawsuits

[edit]

After the election, the National Action Party (PAN), the Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI), the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), and
Citizens' Movement (MC) collectively filed 240 challenges against the
presidential election results. The majority of these challenges were
spearheaded by the PRD, which sought to annul millions of ballots to meet the
3% threshold required to maintain its registration as a national political
party.[175] However, by 8 August, the Electoral Tribunal of the Federal
Judiciary had rejected all of the challenges.[176]

For the legislative elections, all political parties challenged the results
for deputies and senators, citing allegations of exceeding campaign spending
limits, vote buying, voter intimidation, and various irregularities in vote
counting.[177] Most of these challenges, when presented to the Electoral
Tribunal of the Federal Judiciary, were rejected, and any rulings from lower
courts did not alter the overall election results.[177] The only exception was
in the 23rd district of the State of Mexico, where Luis Alberto Carballo
Gutiérrez's victory certificate was annulled due to his ineligibility, as he
was a food debtor,[178] resulting in his alternate assuming the position
instead.[179]

### Reactions

[edit]

#### Financial markets

[edit]

Amid concerns that a supermajority in both chambers of Congress would lead to
anti-market reforms, the peso dropped nearly 4% against the U.S. dollar
following initial reporting;[180] by the end of the week, it was down 10% from
its pre-election level.[181] From less than 17 to the U.S. dollar on 2 June,
the peso fell over the nine days following the election to trade at 18.50 on
11 June,[182] still considerably stronger than the all-time low of over 25
seen at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.[183] On 3 June, the
two largest ETFs focused on Mexico (iShares MSCI Mexico ETF EWW and Franklin
FTSE Mexico ETF FLMX) dropped more than 10%, the biggest daily decline in four
years.[184] The Mexican Stock Exchange ended the 3 June trading day down 6.1%,
while the MSCI Mexico Index dropped 8.8%.[185]
