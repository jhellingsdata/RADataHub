The **2024 Saskatchewan general election** was held on October 28, 2024, to
elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.

The incumbent Saskatchewan Party government, led by Premier Scott Moe since
2018, sought re-election to a fifth consecutive term. The Saskatchewan Party's
primary opponent, the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party (NDP) led by Carla
Beck, sought to lead the NDP to its first government since 2007. This was the
first general election to feature the Saskatchewan United Party (SUP).

The Saskatchewan Party won enough seats to form its fifth consecutive majority
government, claiming the majority of rural ridings. Its majority was reduced
from eleven seats to three by a resurgent NDP—which achieved its best
electoral performance since 2007 by taking all of Regina's districts and all
but two in the Saskatoon area. The SUP lost its only seat, which had been held
by party founder Nadine Wilson. The results underscored the urban–rural divide
between the two parties' constituencies.[1][2][3]

As of October 30, two seats in Saskatoon remain uncalled, with the NDP
currently leading in 1, and the Saskatchewan Party leading in the other.

## Background

[edit]

Since 2010, the Legislative Assembly has had a fixed four-year term. According
to the 2019 amendment to the Legislative Assembly Act, 2007, "the first
general election after the coming into force of this subsection must be held
on Monday, October 26, 2020".[4][5] Subsequent elections, must occur "on the
last Monday of October in the fourth calendar year after the last general
election".[6] However, the act also provides that if the election period would
overlap with a federal election period, the provincial election is to be
postponed until the first Monday of the following April; in this case: April
7, 2025.[6] The fixed election law does not infringe on the Lieutenant
Governor's right to dissolve the Legislative Assembly at an earlier date on
the Premier's advice.

### Redistricting

[edit]

The Saskatchewan Provincial Boundaries Commission drew a new map for
Saskatchewan, as required by the _Constituency Boundaries Act, 1993_ ,[10][11]
which was subsequently ratified by the Saskatchewan Legislature.[12] The
Legislative Assembly continued to consist of 61 members.

### Campaign

[edit]

Health care, education, and the economy have been considered to be among the
top issues heading into the election, with the incumbent Saskatchewan Party
and Saskatchewan NDP focusing primarily on these issues.[13]

The province's health care system has been affected by staffing shortages,
especially in rural areas of the province, which CUPE credited primarily to
the Saskatchewan Health Authority's reliance on part-time workers as opposed
to full-time positions. This has led to significant increases in vacancies and
service disruptions since 2019.[14] In early-October 2024, the emergency room
of Saskatoon's Royal University Hospital operated at 350% capacity after other
nearby facilities were unable to take patients in, causing it to run out of
beds, stretchers, and oxygen.[15][16][17] The Saskatchewan Party touted its
effort to recruit nursing graduates, and internationally-trained nurses from
countries such as the Philippines.[18] It also stated that it would offer at-
home screening kits for HPV, and a refundable tax credit of up to $10,000 for
fertility treatment.[19] Carla Beck stated that the NDP would invest $1.1
billion into critical front line services over the next four years, and focus
on improving working conditions to achieve employee retention.[18] Beck
criticized Scott Moe during the leaders' debate for not making any specific
funding commitments for health care in his party's platform.[20]

The Saskatchewan Teachers' Federation (STF) has been in a labour dispute with
the provincial government since May 2023, citing a lack of action on issues
such as classroom size and complexity.[21][22] After rotating strikes since
January 2024, the STF enacted an indefinite work-to-rule beginning in April
2024.[23][24][20] The Saskatchewan Party and NDP both pledged to place
increased funding into education, with the Sask Party planning to spend $156
million on infrastructure and $336 million on classroom sizes and complexity,
and the NDP planning to increase the education budget by $2 billion over four
years to fund classroom size and complexity, infrastructure, and special needs
programs. Beck also promised a new high school in White City, and the
implementation of a healthy food program.[25][26]

On October 17, expanding upon the _Parents' Bill of Rights_ introduced in
2023, Moe announced his intent to immediately enact rules requiring school
students to use the changing rooms that correspond to their biological sex.
The Saskatchewan Party stated that it had "received calls and correspondence"
regarding a October 16 report from the _Western Standard,_ which detailed a
complaint from the parent of a rural school student who had seen two trans
girls using the girls' changing room. The Canadian Press reported that a
parent of the two students was one of the NDP's candidates.[27][28][29] The
proposal was not in the platform published by the Saskatchewan Party, and
faced criticism from the NDP, STF, and LGBT rights advocates for harming the
safety of transgender students. Regina Douglas Park MLA Nicole Sarauer stated
that "no leader, community, political or otherwise, should aid in anyway to
the outing or othering of children." Saskatchewan Party officials denied it
was directly involved with the outing,[30][31][32] and Moe later claimed he
was unaware of the two children, and that "I never once spoke to any of the
individuals, nor will I, nor should anyone."[27]

On the economic front, Moe stated that he would reduce personal income taxes,
expand the tuition rebate offered in its graduate retention program, remove
the carbon tax on heating oil, and establish new tax credits and rebates for
first-time homeowners and families with children involved in the arts or
sports. Beck stated that she would balance the province's budget within four
years and cut $58 million in "Saskatchewan Party waste" within her first year
of office. Beck also stated that she would suspend the provincial gas tax for
six months, end the PST for groceries and children's clothing, and establish
an accountability commission to investigate issues such as cost overruns on
government projects.[33][34][20][35]

Jon Hromek launched the Saskatchewan United Party's campaign on October 2,
2024, describing it as a "true conservative option", and hoping to have at
least two candidates elected to the Legislative Assembly.[36][37] Its platform
focused on goals such as cutting the provincial sales tax, ending the fuel
tax, lowering property taxes for homeowners over 65, reviewing the royalty
framework for potash, privatization of health care, a commitment to coal and
natural gas energy and the suspension of green energy projects, removing
"ideology" and "indoctrination" from school curricula (including gender
identity and the climate crisis), and proposals to prohibit transgender women
from occupying women-only spaces or competing in women's sports.[37][38] It
was suggested that the Saskatchewan United Party could potentially split the
right-wing vote with the Saskatchewan Party, although Scott Moe downplayed
these concerns.[39][38][40]

On October 22, it was reported that the front window of the office of
Saskatchewan Party candidate Rahul Singh had been vandalized, with damage
resembling small bullet holes. The party initially claimed that the vandalism
was the result of a gun attack. The Regina Police Service stated that it had
investigated a report of mischief reported on the evening of October 21, and
that there was no evidence that firearms were involved.[41][42]

The NDP has received endorsements from multiple current and former
Saskatchewan Party members and MLAs, including from Speaker Randy Weekes.[43]

## Results

[edit]

Although public opinion polling in the latter half of the campaign suggested
that the NDP was leading the Saskatchewan Party in popular support, it
remained unclear whether this would translate into a majority government, as
their lead was based entirely on being ahead in Regina and Saskatoon, while
remaining ten points or more behind in the province's more rural
districts.[140]

Taking nearly all rural ridings and two in Saskatoon (Saskatoon Willowgrove,
and Martensville-Blairmore—which includes the Blairmore neighbourhood of
Saskatoon), the Saskatchewan Party won enough seats to form its fifth
consecutive majority government. If the Saskatchewan Party completes a full
four years in office, it will be the second-longest streak of party control in
Saskatchewan, exceeded only by the Liberal governments of
1905–1929.[141][1][2][3] The NDP reduced the Saskatchewan Party's majority
from eleven seats at dissolution to three, taking all of Regina's ridings and
all but two in Saskatoon. Only one Saskatchewan Party MLA in Saskatoon, Ken
Cheveldayoff, won re-election.[142]

The NDP achieved upset victories over several long-standing Saskatchewan Party
MLAs and ministers, including Bronwyn Eyre, Gene Makowsky, Paul Merriman,
Laura Ross, and Christine Tell.The NDP also reclaimed the far northern seat of
Athabasca, a party stronghold which the party had unexpectedly lost to the
Saskatchewan Party in a 2022 by-election, but did not otherwise make any new
gains in the province's rural districts.[143] The Saskatchewan United Party
failed to win any seats, and lost its sole seat—held by party founder and
former leader Nadine Wilson in the Saskatchewan Rivers riding—to the
Saskatchewan Party candidate Eric Schmalz.[144]

Of the 32,476 mail-in ballots requested, only 20,417 had been returned by
October 30. The remaining 12,059 must be received by November 7 (two days
before the Final Count) in order to be validly entered into the total
result.[145] There may yet be judicial recounts: under Saskatchewan law, they
may only be requested by a candidate, and only if there is a tie or where the
margin of victory is less than the number of rejected ballots and others
objected to.[145]

## Notes

[edit]

  1. **^** Currently Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.
  2. **^** The Biggar-Sask Valley constituency was eliminated following redistribution, prompting Weekes, then a Saskatchewan Party MLA, to seek the party's nomination in Kindersley-Biggar, which includes a portion of the former Biggar-Sask Valley constituency. Weekes later left the Saskatchewan Party after losing the nomination.
