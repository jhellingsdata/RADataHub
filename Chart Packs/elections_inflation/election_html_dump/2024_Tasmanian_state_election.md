The **2024 Tasmanian state election** was held on 23 March 2024 to elect all
35 members to the House of Assembly.

The House of Assembly uses the proportional Hare-Clark system of voting, with
the 35 members elected from five seven-member constituencies. The Assembly's
size was increased from 25 to 35 seats at this election, under the provisions
of the _Expansion of House of Assembly Act 2022_ , assented to in December
2022.[2][3] The election was conducted by the Tasmanian Electoral Commission.
Elections for the 15-seat single-member district upper house, known as the
Legislative Council, which use full-preference instant-runoff voting, are
staggered each year and conducted separately from lower house state elections.

The Liberal government, led by Premier Jeremy Rockliff, and the Labor
opposition, led by Rebecca White, both attempted to win majority government.
The Greens and the Jacqui Lambie Network also contested the election, as well
as several independents and other minor parties.

The election resulted in a hung parliament, with the Liberal Party remaining
the largest party by both vote share and seat total; winning 14 seats. Labor
and the Greens won 10 and five seats respectively, with both parties
experiencing only a small increase in their respective vote percentages,
despite a large swing against the Liberal Party. The majority of the swing
went to independents and the Jacqui Lambie Network, who won three seats in its
first state election. Both major parties fell short of a majority, with the
Liberals and Labor requiring four and eight seats respectively from the
crossbench to form government.[4]

The day after the election, Labor conceded and its leader Rebecca White stated
the party would not seek to negotiate with other MPs to form a government,
triggering a leadership election.[5] On 10 April, the Liberal Party and Jacqui
Lambie Network announced an agreement had been reached for the latter to
provide confidence and supply to the government.[6] The second Rockliff
ministry was sworn in the following day with Independent MP David O'Byrne
providing written assurance of confidence and supply, giving the Liberal party
the numbers required to form government.[7][8]

Ultimately, both O'Byrne and fellow independent Kristie Johnston signed
confidence and supply agreements with the government, giving it 19 of the 35
votes on the floor of the parliament.[9] It was the first time that a non-
Labor party in Tasmania had won a fourth consecutive term in government since
adopting the Liberal banner in 1945.[10]

## Date

[edit]

Under section 23 of the Constitution Act 1934, the House of Assembly was to
expire four years from the return of the writs for its election, which took
place on 1 May 2021.[11] The Governor must issue writs of election between
five and ten days thereafter.[12] Nominations must close on a date seven to
twenty-one days after the issuance of the writ,[13] and polling day must be a
Saturday between 22 and 30 days after nominations close.[14]

In May 2023, Premier Jeremy Rockliff ruled out holding an early election, in
contrast to his predecessor (Peter Gutwein), who called the last state
election a year early.[15] However on 14 February 2024, Rockliff visited with
Governor Barbara Baker to request that an election be called a year early
after the Liberal government was forced into a minority, a request which was
accepted. It was the second consecutive occasion the Premier of Tasmania
called a snap election after Gutwein called the previous state election a year
early for a similar reason.

### Key dates

### Previous election

[edit]

Further information: David O'Byrne misconduct allegations

After the snap 2021 election, the Liberal Party successfully won a majority of
seats in the Tasmanian House of Assembly.[18] A Liberal MP for Braddon, Adam
Brooks, resigned on 14 May 2021 after being charged with firearms offences by
Queensland law enforcement. These offences were unauthorised possession of a
Category H weapon, unauthorised possession of explosives, and dealing with
identity documents. Premier Peter Gutwein said that "I made the decision that
under the circumstances of both his mental health and in terms of the fact
that he's now facing these new charges, that he won't take his seat in
parliament." Greens leader Cassy O'Connor said that "there are now very
serious questions to answer about whether or not he was ever considered a
legitimate candidate by the Liberal Party", given he resigned "the day the
polls [were] declared". Prior claims from women were made before the 2021
election, saying they were catfished by Brooks under the alias "Terry
Brooks".[19] Despite the resignation, the Liberal Party's numbers in the House
of Assembly were unchanged, due to the replacing member being a member of the
party.

Rebecca_White_in_Hobart_%28April_2021%29_%28cropped%29.jpg)

David O'Byrne (_left_) served as Labor leader for 22 days, resigning over
sexual harassment allegations. His predecessor as leader, Rebecca White
(_right_) returned to the leadership role after O'Byrne's resignation.

Rebecca White resigned as Labor leader on 15 May 2021, endorsing shadow
treasurer David O'Byrne to replace her.[20][21] On 15 June 2021, it was
announced that O'Byrne had been elected as leader of the Tasmanian Labor Party
against opponent Shane Broad, winning 72% of the members' vote and 75% of
party delegates.[22] After allegations of him sexting and kissing a woman
without her consent were revealed, David O'Byrne stood aside from his role as
leader of the Labor Party for the length of an investigation on 30 June 2021,
with Anita Dow acting as leader during the interim.[23] This was followed by
O'Byrne announcing he would resign as leader on 4 July 2021.[24] On 7 July
2021, Rebecca White was elected as leader after a meeting of the Labor
parliamentary caucus.[25]

### Resignation of Peter Gutwein

[edit]

On 4 April 2022, Premier Peter Gutwein announced he would quit politics,
resigning as Premier and as a member for Bass following the appointment of a
new Premier.[26] Jeremy Rockliff, who had been the deputy Liberal leader for
16 years, officially replaced Gutwein as Premier on 8 April 2022, with Bass MP
Michael Ferguson as his deputy.[27]

### Restoration of 35 seats in Assembly

[edit]

On 25 May 2022, Premier Rockliff announced his intention to table a bill in
State Parliament to restore the state's House of Assembly to 35 seats before
the end of 2022.[28][29] The bill restored the size of parliament to its
original number before the reductions to 25 seats was implemented at the 1998
election. The change will come into effect at this election. The legislation
was supported by the Liberals, Labor, Greens and independent Kristie
Johnston.[30] It became law upon its assent by the Governor in December
2022.[2]

### Minority government and a snap election

[edit]

On 11 May 2023, MPs Lara Alexander and John Tucker resigned as members of the
Tasmanian Liberal Party and from all parliamentary committees, and served the
remainder of their terms as independents on the crossbench. This left the
Liberal party in minority government and requiring 7 seats to reach a majority
in the next state election.[31] Tucker and Alexander both agreed to provide
the government with confidence and supply.[1]

On 4 January 2024, Tucker threatened to withdraw his support for the
government if it failed to act on his demands for mandatory CCTV in all
abattoirs in the state and the cessation of planning for a professional sports
training facility at Rosny Parklands and a 25,000-seat stadium at Macquarie
Point for an Australian Football League (AFL) team in 2028.[32] In response
Rockliff stated in an interview on 2 February, that he would ask the Governor
for a snap election if Tucker and Alexander failed to agree on a new governing
deal that required the two MPs to not support proposals or changes to
legislation raised by Labor, Green or other independent MPs in parliament
without the permission of the government.[33] On 13 February, Rockliff
announced that the Liberal party room had endorsed a snap election due to
there being no agreement reached between the government and the independent
MPs.[34] The following day Rockliff visited Governor Barbara Baker at
Government House, who accepted his request for an election to be held on 23
March 2024.[35]

### Changes in parliamentary composition

Since the 2021 election, there were a number of changes within the Tasmanian

## Campaign

[edit]

On 29 February 2024, Rockliff stated that if re-elected, his government would
remove the protections from 40,000 hectares of protected native forest,
allowing them to be logged.[38]

On 10 March 2024, Rockliff committed A$12 million to support building a
"chocolate experience" centre near the Hobart Cadbury factory, which would
include the "world's largest chocolate fountain".[39]

On 11 March 2024, White put forth plans for a shared-equity housing scheme
that would allow couples earning under $200,000 and singles earning under
$150,000 to partake in a deal with the government, allowing them to buy a
property without a deposit, and the government retaining a 20% share of the
property.[40]

On 14 March 2024, social media erupted after a mock website of the Jacqui
Lambie Network was discovered online.[41] The URL (lambienetwork.com) is said
by various media outlets to be shockingly similar to Lambie's true website,
(lambienetwork.com.au).[42] The page is owned by the Liberals as is evident by
authorisation details on the page.[43] The page itself is a mock-up of the
style of the valid page, instead criticising Senator Lambie and her candidates
for a lack of policies in the upcoming election.[44] Lambie described herself
as "absolutely ropable" when she became aware of the page.[42] When Premier
Rockliff was asked about the page, he stated, "We have every right to point
out the policy failings of all political parties."[45] The Tasmanian Electoral
Commission has been contacted about the page.[42]

On 17 March 2024, Rockliff announced an intention to amend the Tasmanian
Constitution to add a clause that would legislate that if an MP left the party
on which they were elected, they would vacate their seat of parliament.[46]
The proposed amendment has been criticised by various officials, including
former-Liberal turned independent MP, John Tucker. Tucker designated the
legislation as "Rocky's rule or else." Among other criticisms.[47] Rockliff
describes it as the only way to ensure a stable government continues
throughout the term.[46] Labor candidate for Franklin, Dean Winter, speculates
the legislation may be in attempt to prevent candidate Eric Abetz from
diverging from the Liberals in event of disagreement on same-sex conversion
laws, of which Abetz has countering views to his party.[48]

On 20 March 2024, during the Sky News Australia Peoples Forum debate between
White and Rockliff, White pledged that if a Labor government was elected in
this election, they will construct a public elective surgery hospital in New
Town, Tasmania. The hospital is proposed to have 24 overnight beds, along with
8 theatres. The budget is expected to be $160m, and would be completed by
2027.[49]

The Jacqui Lambie Network ran for parliament with a no policy
agenda.[50][51][52]

## Opinion polling

[edit]

Polling is regularly conducted for Tasmanian state politics by Enterprise
Marketing and Research Services (EMRS). The sample size for each EMRS poll is
1,000 Tasmanian voters.[53]

### Voting intention

[edit]

The latest polling by uComms on behalf The Australia Institute indicates that
the Liberals will win 13 seats, Labor would win 8, The Greens would win 5,
Lambie Network 3, and there would be 6 Independents. This would indicate that
neither of the major parties could win a majority, and instead would need to
form a minority government with Lambie, Greens or Independent MPs. Although
both major parties have expressed a dislike in forming coalition,[54][55] with
Labor outright denying a Greens-Labor coalition,[56] and the Liberals refusing
to trade policies.[57] The Greens are holding out hope for a coalition,
stating they prefer Labor over Liberals in terms of forming a minority
government.[58]

## Aftermath

[edit]

Further information: 2024 Tasmanian government formation and Second Rockliff
ministry

The day after the election, Labor conceded and its leader Rebecca White stated
the party was not in a position to form a minority government, causing a
leadership election to be held under the party's constitution.[5] Rockliff
reportedly began discussions with elected independents and Jacqui Lambie
Network (JLN) candidates to form a Liberal minority government.[5] On 10
April, the Liberal Party and Jacqui Lambie Network announced an agreement had
been reached for the latter to provide confidence and supply to the
government.[6] The second Rockliff ministry was sworn in by Governor Barbara
Baker the following day,[7] as Rockliff revealed independent MP David O'Byrne
had provided a written assurance of confidence and supply votes in parliament,
thereby enabling the re-elected government to take office.[8] Letters of
confidence and supply assurances were signed by O'Byrne and another
independent MP, Kristie Johnston, and were released to the public on 24 April
2024.[9] This gave the Liberal government 19 votes out of 35 in parliament to
govern.

The JLN-Liberal arrangement lasted in its original form for only four months,
as two of the JLN MPs, Rebekah Pentland and Miriam Beswick, were expelled from
the party by party leader Jacqui Lambie, who alleged the two MPs no longer
represented the "values of accountability, transparency and integrity".[73]
Both Pentland and Beswick stated they intended to remain in parliament as
independents and later signed a new confidence and supply agreement with the
government.[74][75]

On 16 September 2024, the sole remaining member of the JLN in parliament,
Andrew Jenner, confirmed he was not signing a confidence and supply deal with
the Liberal government after the last one fell through.[76]

## Notes

[edit]

  1. **^** In May 2023 Liberal MHAs Lara Alexander (Bass) and John Tucker (Lyons) resigned from the party and left the government to sit on the crossbench as independents. They agreed to provide the government with confidence and supply.[1]
  2. **^** Labor Party leader David O'Byrne resigned his position two months after the 2021 state election following misconduct allegations. A month after the allegations were made O'Byrne sat on the crossbench as an Independent Labor MHA.
  3. **^** Jacqui Lambie sits in the Australian Senate as a senator from Tasmania.
