The **2024 Northern Territory general election** was held on 24 August 2024 to
elect all 25 members of the Legislative Assembly in the unicameral Northern
Territory Parliament. Members were elected through full preferential instant-
runoff voting in single-member electorates. The election was conducted by the
Northern Territory Electoral Commission (NTEC).

The incumbent centre-left Labor majority government, led by Chief Minister Eva
Lawler since December 2023, sought to win a third consecutive four-year term
of government. They were defeated by the centre-right Country Liberal Party
(CLP) opposition, led by Opposition Leader Lia Finocchiaro, in a
landslide.[2][3]

The election saw the second-worst defeat of a sitting government in the
Territory's history. From 14 seats at dissolution, Labor fell to four seats,
its smallest presence in the Legislative Assembly since it entered the chamber
in 1977; it won no seats at the first ever Northern Territory election in
1974. Labor also tallied its lowest primary vote in the Territory and suffered
a complete wipeout in the urban areas of Darwin and Palmerston. The CLP
swelled to 17 seats, up from seven at dissolution, giving the party a four-
seat majority. There was a large swing to the CLP across Darwin, Palmerston
and Alice Springs, as well as in the surrounding rural areas and in Katherine.
The CLP swept the city of Palmerston and won all but two seats in Darwin and
all but one seat in Alice Springs. The swing led to Eva Lawler losing her seat
of Drysdale to CLP candidate Clinton Howe. She became the third Chief Minister
and the first Labor Chief Minister lose her seat at an election.[4]

Of the four remaining seats, three were won by independents and one by left-
wing minor party the Greens, whose candidate Kat McNamara defeated former
Chief Minister Natasha Fyles in the seat of Nightcliff. This marked the first
time the Greens entered the Legislative Assembly in the history of the
Northern Territory.[5]

For the first time in Northern Territory history, both major parties at the
election were led by female leaders. Additionally, both leaders were from the
city of Palmerston; indeed, before her move to the then-new seat of Spillett
in 2016, Finocchiaro was the member for Drysdale (the seat Lawler won in 2016
after Finocchiaro transferred to Spillett). Voter turnout dropped in remote
Aboriginal communities, which the NTEC attributed to voter fatigue and apathy;
others suggested the rejection of the Indigenous Voice to Parliament at the
2023 referendum contributed to low turnout among Indigenous voters.[6]

With the Northern Territory election results, Labor lost its first mainland
state or territory since the 2018 South Australian election.

## Background

[edit]

This was the first election for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly
where both major political parties were led by women, and the third in any
Australian state or territory, after the 1995 ACT election and 2020 Queensland
election.

Additionally, both leaders were from the city of Palmerston. Before her move
to the then-new seat of Spillett in 2016, Finocchiaro was the member for
Drysdale, the seat Lawler won in that election.

### Previous election

[edit]

At the 2020 election, the Labor government led by Chief Minister Michael
Gunner was re-elected with a reduced majority, winning 14 of the 25 seats in
the parliament. The Country Liberals (CLP) won 8 seats, whilst the Territory
Alliance party won 1 seat and a further 2 seats were won by independents.

### Parliamentary composition

[edit]

Robyn Lambley, the Territory Alliance's sole representative in the parliament,
left the party in October 2020 to sit as an independent.[7] Labor MLA Mark
Turner was expelled from the party-room caucus in February 2021 due to what he
acknowledged as an "inappropriate relationship" with a Labor Party staffer,
though he remained a Labor-designated member in the assembly.[8]

A by-election was held for the seat of Daly on 11 September 2021, caused by
the resignation of CLP member Ian Sloan due to health and personal issues.
Labor candidate Dheran Young won the seat, the first time that an incumbent
government has won a seat from the opposition in the history of the
Legislative Assembly.[9]

On 10 May 2022, Chief Minister and Labor leader Michael Gunner announced his
immediate resignation from both positions, citing his desire to spend more
time with his family following the birth of his and his wife's second son on
29 April.[10] Following a party-room meeting on 13 May, Labor minister Natasha
Fyles was elected unopposed to the leadership, and was sworn in as the new
Chief Minister later that day.[11] Gunner resigned from the seat of Fannie Bay
on 27 July and a by-election was held on 20 August 2022. Labor retained the
seat at the by-election, with Labor candidate Brent Potter retaining the seat
despite a 7 per cent swing against the party.[12]

On 17 December 2022, Labor MP for Arafura Lawrence Costa died. This triggered
a by-election which was held on 18 March 2023. Manuel Brown retained the seat
for Labor with a 15.6% swing towards the party on the two-party-preferred
result.

In December 2023, it was revealed that Fyles holds 754 undeclared shares in
South32, a company that owns a manganese mine on Groote Eylandt. Fyles faced
further conflict of interest allegations and calls to resign, due to her
decision earlier in 2023 to not investigate health impacts from the Groote
Eylandt mine, with Leader of the Opposition Lia Finocchiaro calling her
actions a 'profound betrayal of public trust'.[13][14] Due to the controversy,
Fyles resigned on 19 December 2023.[14]

Three independents were elected at the 2020 election, the crossbench then
increased to 4 when Mark Turner was expelled from the Labor Party.

## Redistribution

[edit]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/2024_Northern_Territory_general_election_%28draft_redistributions%29.jpg/250px-2024_Northern_Territory_general_election_%28draft_redistributions%29.jpg)A
map showing the first proposal of redistribution.

A redistribution took place in preparation for the 2024 election, largely due
to the rapid population growth of Palmerston, but minor changes were also made
to electorates outside the town.

The first redistribution proposal was published on 23 May 2023.[15]

## Election date

[edit]

The parliament has fixed four-year terms, with elections to be held on the
fourth Saturday of August every four years.[16]

## Campaign issues

[edit]

The most prominent issue in the campaign was crime, which has dramatically
increased in the Territory in recent years.[29] Other issues included cost of
living and pet crocodiles.[30]

The Country Liberal Party (CLP) had a policy to lower the age of criminal
responsibility from 12 to 10 years old, reversing the Gunner government's 2022
increase.[31][32][33]

The CLP swept Labor from power in a massive landslide, winning 58 percent of
the two-party vote on a swing of 11 percent. The swing was particularly
pronounced in Darwin and Palmerston. The CLP took all of Palmerston and all
but two seats in Darwin, all on swings of over 10 percent. Notably, the CLP
took five out of seven seats in Darwin's northern suburbs, which had been
Labor's power base in the Territory since the turn of the millennium. Labor
won power for the first time in 2001 by sweeping the northern suburbs, and
retained all but one seat there even when defeated in 2012. It initially
appeared Fyles in Nightcliff would be the only Labor member left in the
Darwin/Palmerston area, but the Greens narrowly defeated her to complete
Labor's urban wipeout.

Lawler herself was defeated in Drysdale by CLP challenger Clinton Howe on a
swing of over 21 percent, enough on paper to turn it into a safe CLP seat in
one stroke. She is the third head of government in the Territory and the
fourth major-party leader to lose their own seat. All but two members of her
cabinet were defeated, the only survivors being Deputy Chief Minister Chansey
Paech and Selena Uibo.

## Notes

[edit]

  1. **^** The Country Liberal Party lost the electorate of Daly to Labor at a by-election in 2021.
  2. **^** On 18 February 2021, Mark Turner, the member for Blain, was expelled from the Labor Party caucus but remained a rank-and-file member of the party, although he sits on the crossbench, bringing Labor's seat total to thirteen. However, Labor won the seat of Daly from the Country Liberal Party at the 2021 Daly by-election on 11 September 2021, bringing their seat total back to fourteen. Turner was later expelled from the party completely.[1]
  3. **^** Manuel Brown was elected at the 2023 Arafura by-election after the death of Lawrence Costa
  4. **^** 3.6% was the Labor margin at the 2020 general election. The Labor margin after the 2023 Arafura by-election was 19.1%.
  5. **^** Dheran Young was elected at the 2021 Daly by-election after the resignation of Ian Sloan
  6. **^** The margin after the 2021 Daly by-election was 7.3% for Labor. The by-election margin adjusted for redistribution is 6.1% for Labor. The margin at the 2020 general election was 1.2% for the Country Liberal Party
  7. **^** Brent Potter was elected at the 2022 Fannie Bay by-election after the resignation of former Chief Minister Michael Gunner
  8. **^** 10.9% was the Labor margin at the 2020 general election. The Labor margin after the 2022 Fannie Bay by-election was 2.2%.
  9. **^** The Labor margin in Arnhem at the 2020 general election was 1.4% versus Independent Ian Mongunu Gumbula. Gumbula is running as a CLP candidate in the 2024 general election without the support of Mulka Independent MLA Yingiya Mark Guyula who supported him in 2020, which would make the 2020 two-party preferred result adjusted for redistribution a better measure of the contest.
  10. **^** Mark Turner was expelled from the Labor Party caucus in 2021 and from the party completely in 2023.[1]
  11. **^** Margin is an ABC estimate
  12. **^** The TPP estimates have been manually calculated based on preference flows.[26]
  13. **^** Animal Justice Party 2.4%
  14. **^** Includes the now defunct, Territory Alliance, who were a 12.90% share of this figure.
  15. **^** Mark Turner was elected as a Labor candidate, but was sacked from the party.
