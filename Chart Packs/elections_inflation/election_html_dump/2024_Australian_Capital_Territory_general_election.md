The **2024 Australian Capital Territory general election** was held on 19
October 2024 to elect all 25 members of the unicameral ACT Legislative
Assembly.[1]

The centre-left Labor Party, led by Chief Minister Andrew Barr, which had been
in government in the territory since the 2001 election, and in coalition with
the progressive Greens since 2012, sought to win a seventh consecutive term in
office. They were challenged by the centre-right Liberal Party, led by
Opposition Leader Elizabeth Lee, as well as several minor parties and
independent candidates. Lee is the first Asian Australian leader of a state or
territory opposition.[2][a]

Following several hours of vote counting, media outlets and election analysts
projected Labor had won the election, having won sufficient seats to form a
government with the support of the Greens and potentially other
crossbenchers.[3][4] Labor won 10 seats in the assembly, steady with their
result in the previous election, though the party did suffer a swing against
them of more than three percent. The Liberal vote slipped by around half a
point and the party retained nine seats. The Greens vote also dropped, in this
case by slightly above one percent, and ministers Rebecca Vassarotti and Emma
Davidson lost their seats to reduce the party's share of seats in the chamber
to four. The swings against these parties were picked up by minor parties and
independents, resulting in Thomas Emerson of the Independents for Canberra
party winning a seat in Kurrajong and Fiona Carrick (who ran under an
eponymous party banner) winning the final seat in Murrumbidgee.[5][6]

The formation of the government in the eleventh assembly will take place over
the coming weeks.

The election was conducted by Elections ACT.

## Background

[edit]

Labor was attempting to win re-election for a seventh consecutive term (either
with a majority of seats or via forming a coalition with another party) in the
25-member unicameral Legislative Assembly. The party formed a coalition
government with the Greens after the last election, and together the two
parties held 16 of the 25 seats in the Assembly. Elizabeth Lee replaced
Alistair Coe as Liberal leader and Leader of the Opposition following the
party's defeat at the 2020 election.

The composition of the assembly was unchanged until 12 November 2023, when
Greens MLA Johnathan Davis resigned from the assembly and as a member of the
Greens. He was replaced by Laura Nuttall after a countback was conducted.[7]

In September 2024, Ginninderra MLA Elizabeth Kikkert was disendorsed by the
Liberals over alleged breaches of the Electoral Act 1992 and allegations of
bullying of party staff. On 24 September 2024, she subsequently joined the
Family First Party and unsuccessfully sought re-election in the seat under her
new party's banner.[8][9]

## Electoral system

[edit]

The election was conducted by the ACT Electoral Commission, also known as
Elections ACT. All members of the unicameral Assembly faced re-election, with
members being elected by the Hare-Clark system of proportional representation.
The Assembly is divided into five electorates with five members elected from
each electorate:[10]

  * Brindabella – contains the district of Tuggeranong.
  * Ginninderra – contains the district of Belconnen (except the suburbs of Giralang and Kaleen).
  * Kurrajong – contains the districts of Canberra Central (excluding Deakin, Forrest, Red Hill, and Yarralumla), Jerrabomberra, Kowen and Majura.
  * Murrumbidgee – contains the districts of the Woden Valley, Weston Creek, Molonglo Valley, and the South Canberra suburbs of Deakin, Forrest, Red Hill, and Yarralumla.
  * Yerrabi – contains the districts of Gungahlin, Hall and the Belconnen suburbs of Giralang and Kaleen.

## Campaign

[edit]

The election period began on 13 September, when candidate nominations opened.
On 24 September, nominations closed, and the following day, the randomly
allocated ballot draw was announced.[29]

Chief Minister Andrew Barr launched the ACT Labor campaign on 13 September,
alongside Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, and former Chief Minister and
current federal Finance Minister Katy Gallagher.[30] Opposition Leader
Elizabeth Lee launched the Canberra Liberals' campaign on 5 October, alongside
former Chief Minister Kate Carnell.[31]

Prominent campaign issues included infrastructure (particularly proposals for
a new stadium in Civic),[32][33] public transport (especially light
rail),[34][35][36] and housing.[37][38]

Much of the messaging of opposition candidates focused on the fact that the
Labor Party have led the Government of the Australian Capital Territory for
the last 23 years.[39][40] If Andrew Barr wins re-election, he would become
the only incumbent premier or chief minister to have won three elections,
following the resignations of Daniel Andrews and Annastacia Palaszczuk in late
2023. The presence of many independents among the candidates, including but
not limited to the new political grouping Independents for Canberra, was also
notable.[41][42]

### Controversy

[edit]

Certain individual candidates attracted controversy during the course of the
campaign.

On 25 September, Liberal candidate Darren Roberts was accused by Labor of
posting offensive content online related to the Voice to Parliament and dual
naming, using a pseudonym account.[43][44]

On 3 October, reports emerged that Liberal MLA Peter Cain, when he worked as a
schoolteacher in 2002, wrote a workbook on Australian history that presented a
Christian white savior narrative and did not mention the frontier
wars.[45][46][47]

On 10 October, Greens candidate Harini Rangajaran was found to have written a
blog post about martyrdom on Substack in 2023, a creative writing exercise
that made mention of idolising Osama bin Laden.[48][49][50]

On 14 October, Greens candidate James Cruz was criticised for comments made in
Facebook posts in 2014 and 2015, in which he expressed an apparent desire to
"kill politicians" who enabled immigration detention, and an indifference
towards the killing of Israeli soldiers.[51][52][53]

Lastly, on 16 October, Opposition Leader Elizabeth Lee made headlines when she
was filmed giving the finger to a journalist at the end of a combative press
conference.[54][55][56]
