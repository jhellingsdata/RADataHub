Legislative elections were held in Austria on 29 September 2024 to elect the
28th National Council, the lower house of Austria's bicameral parliament.

The election saw the far-right Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) place first,
winning 28.8% of the vote and achieving its best result in the party's
history. It also marked the first time that a far-right party won the most
seats in a legislative election in Austria after World War II.[1][2][3] The
governing Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) lost 20 seats, while its coalition
partner, the Greens, lost 10 seats. The centre-left Social Democratic Party
(SPÖ) won just 21.1%, marking its worst result ever in terms of percentages
and the place occupied (3rd), but it gained one seat compared to the previous
election. NEOS slightly improved from 2019, rising from 15 to 18 seats. No
other party was able to clear the 4% threshold to win seats.

## Background

[edit]

The 2019 legislative election was called after the Ibiza affair, which
triggered the collapse of the coalition government between the Austrian
People's Party (ÖVP) and the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) led by Chancellor
Sebastian Kurz. The coalition was ousted in a motion of no confidence and
replaced by a non-partisan interim government.[4] The election delivered a
strong victory for the ÖVP, which rose to 37.5%, while the FPÖ declined to
16%, its worst result since 2008. With 21%, the opposition Social Democratic
Party of Austria (SPÖ) recorded its worst performance in over a century. The
Greens returned to the National Council after failing to win seats in 2017,
achieving its best-ever result with 14%. NEOS improved to 8%.[5]

The ÖVP formed a coalition with The Greens, a first on the federal level in
Austria. The new government took office in January 2020, with Sebastian Kurz
returning as Chancellor.[6]

Norbert Hofer announced his resignation as leader of the Freedom Party in June
2021. He was replaced by parliamentary group leader Herbert Kickl, whose
dismissal as interior minister caused the collapse of the ÖVP–FPÖ government
in 2019.[7]

On 6 October 2021 agents of the Central Prosecutorial Agency for Corruption
and Economic Affairs (WKStA) raided the Federal Chancellery and the
headquarters of the ÖVP as part of a corruption probe targeting Chancellor
Sebastian Kurz and his "inner circle". Prosecutors alleged that, in 2016, Kurz
paid bribes to news outlets to publish coverage and opinion polling favourable
to himself, the goal of the scheme being to undermine then-ÖVP leader Reinhold
Mitterlehner so that Kurz could take his place.[8] The Greens threatened to
support a motion of no confidence if Kurz did not step down as Chancellor. He
thus announced his resignation on 9 October and was replaced by Foreign
Minister Alexander Schallenberg. However, he was quickly elected faction
leader of the ÖVP in the National Council; it was widely understood that he
would remain _de facto_ leader of the government.[9][10]

On 2 December Kurz announced he would resign from all offices and retire from
politics, citing a desire to focus on his family after becoming a father.
Shortly after, Schallenberg announced he would resign as Chancellor in favour
of the new ÖVP leader once one had been elected.[11] On 3 December, Interior
Minister Karl Nehammer was unanimously appointed as leader of the ÖVP by the
federal party committee and proposed as Chancellor.[12] He was sworn in by
President Alexander Van der Bellen on 6 December.[13]

Since 2019 numerous new and old minor parties such as Team HC Strache –
Alliance for Austria, MFG Austria – People Freedom Fundamental Rights, The
Beer Party and the Communist Party of Austria received at times considerable
support in the 2020 Viennese state election, 2021 Upper Austrian state
election, 2022 Austrian presidential election, 2023 Salzburg state election
and various local elections, allowing these parties to win seats.

During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ÖVP-Green government
enjoyed high support. The government then became deeply unpopular after it
passed a mandatory vaccination law, which led to a strong polarization of the
population. As a result, and because of large-scale public protests, the
mandatory vaccination law (one of few in the world) was later dropped and was
never enforced.[_citation needed_]

After a series of corruption scandals involving the ÖVP and rising inflation –
such as skyrocketing housing, electricity, fuel and grocery prices – the
government parties lost considerable support in 4 subsequent state elections
in Tyrol, Lower Austria, Carinthia and Salzburg. As of May 2023, inflation in
Austria was still around 10% and continues to be much higher than the Eurozone
average, at around 7%.[_citation needed_]

Under Nehammer's leadership, Austria's government implemented a package of
measures worth six billion euros ($6.3 billion)[_as of?_] in 2022 aimed at
cushioning the blow to households of the rising cost of living.[14] The
measures helped limit poverty, but according to experts increased inflation
further.[_citation needed_]

On 8 December 2022 Nehammer was the architect of blocking Romania and
Bulgaria's access into the Schengen Area. Nehammer said he first wants the EU
to introduce strict border controls at the EU's outer border to limit illegal
immigration before the two countries should be allowed to join Schengen.[15]

On 3 June 2023, after years of internal conflicts, intrigues and crossfire,
the opposition SPÖ elected a new party leader. The non-binding party
membership vote ahead of the binding party congress was won by Hans Peter
Doskozil, although by a simple plurality of votes, leaving the door open for a
challenge by second-place finisher Andreas Babler at the party congress. On 23
May 2023, incumbent party leader Pamela Rendi-Wagner announced that she would
not be a candidate at the party congress, after coming in just third in the
membership vote and announced her orderly resignation. On 25 May 2023, Rendi-
Wagner announced her complete withdrawal from Austrian politics by the end of
June, also resigning as a member of the Austrian Parliament. On 3 June 2023,
Hans Peter Doskozil was elected as the new party chairman with 53% of the
delegates. However, two days later the SPÖ announced that the results had been
mixed up in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and that Babler was the actual winner
with 53%, thus becoming the new party chairman.[16]

The weakness of both the government parties and the SPÖ has allowed the far-
right, populist opposition party FPÖ to top the polls during 2023, positioning
it to win an Austrian legislative election for the first time, even though it
has previously been involved in the Ibiza affair scandal which caused the 2019
governing coalition to resign.[_citation needed_]

A government led by the FPÖ and a Chancellor Herbert Kickl, a political
hardliner, is opposed by about two in three Austrians, according to polls
conducted in May 2023. Additionally, President Alexander Van der Bellen has
said that he might not swear in a FPÖ-led government with a Chancellor Kickl
on top, but that he remains open to swearing in a more moderate FPÖ
Chancellor.[_citation needed_]

The rising inflation and increasingly unaffordable housing situation has seen
the Communist Party of Austria (KPÖ) rise considerably in opinion polls
conducted before the legislative election. Previously a non-factor in Austria-
wide elections, the party rose to as high as 7 percent after the Salzburg
state election in April 2023, in which it received a record 12 percent of the
vote, a result out of nowhere, which stunned political observers.[_citation
needed_]

On 18 October 2023 former chancellor Sebastian Kurz (ÖVP) was charged in
federal court for allegedly making false statements to a parliamentary
investigation committee.[_citation needed_]

On 4 November 2023 the KPÖ elected Tobias Schweiger as their lead candidate
for the upcoming election.[_citation needed_]

On 11 November 2023 the new SPÖ leader Andreas Babler was confirmed at a party
convention in Graz by 89 percent of voting delegates.[17]

On 18 January 2024 Dominik Wlazny (alias Marco Pogo) announced the candidacy
of the Beer Party (BIER).[18]

### Date

[edit]

The election must be held before the conclusion of the 5-year term of the
current 27th National Council on 23 October 2024 (typically, regularly-
scheduled elections are held several weeks earlier than that – to allow for
the publication of an official certified election result). Elections are
traditionally not held during the school summer holidays, from early July to
mid-September.[_citation needed_]

Due to the government's unpopularity, it was often speculated in the media
that early elections would be called for the spring of 2024, but the ÖVP-Green
government repeatedly said it wanted to finish its term and that the election
would be held in September 2024.[19]

In February 2024 Minister of Agriculture Norbert Totschnig (ÖVP) mentioned
that the election will likely be held on Sunday, 29 September 2024, exactly 5
years after the previous election.[_citation needed_]

On 28 June 2024, the federal government formally announced the election date
of 29 September 2024.[20] Polling stations opened at 07:00 and closed at
17:00.[21]

## Electoral system

[edit]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Wien_-
_Parlamentsgeb%C3%A4ude.JPG/200px-Wien_-_Parlamentsgeb%C3%A4ude.JPG)Austrian
Parliament in Vienna (2023)

The 183 members of the National Council are elected by open list proportional
representation at three levels; a single national constituency, nine
constituencies based on the federal states, and 39 regional constituencies.
Seats are apportioned to the regional constituencies based on the results of
the most recent census. For parties to receive any representation in the
National Council, they must either win at least one seat in a constituency
directly, or clear a 4 percent national electoral threshold.[22]

Following the elections, seats are allocated to the candidates of successful
parties and lists in a three-stage process, starting with the regional
constituencies. Seats are distributed according to the Hare quota in the
regional constituencies, and with unallocated seats distributed at the state
constituency level.[23] Any remaining seats are then allocated using the
D'Hondt method at the federal level, to ensure overall proportionality between
a party's national vote share and its share of parliamentary seats.[24]

In addition to voting for a political party, voters may cast three
preferential votes for specific candidates of that party, but are not required
to do so.[25] These additional votes do not affect the proportional allocation
based on the vote for the party or list, but can change the rank order of
candidates on a party's lists at the federal, state, and regional level. The
threshold to increase the position of a candidate on a federal party list is 7
percent, compared to 10 percent at the state level, and 14 percent at the
regional level. The names of candidates on regional party lists are printed on
the ballot and can be marked with an "x" to indicate the voter's preference.
Preference votes for candidates on party lists at the state and federal level,
however, must be written in by the voter, either by writing the name or the
rank number of the candidate in a blank spot provided for that purpose.[26]

### Voting law reform

[edit]

In early 2023 the ÖVP–Green government decided to reform the voting law. Among
the reforms were the introduction of an early voting period, starting 3 weeks
before election day, during which voters can request absentee ballots in every
municipality. Voters can either fill out the ballot in the municipality and
therefore cast the ballot early, or take the absentee ballot with them and
cast it later by mail, or in-person before or on election day. Previously,
this was only possible in large cities. Another reform will be the counting of
almost all absentee and mail-ballots on election day. Previously, most mail
ballots were counted the Monday and Thursday after election day. The new
changes will lead to most votes being counted on election day, while only a
much smaller number of late-arriving mail ballots and mail ballots from
electoral districts other than the voters' own district will be counted on
Monday after election day. The 2024 European Parliament election in Austria
was the first national election in which the new law took effect and it showed
that only about 130,000 absentee ballots had to be counted on the Monday after
election day, compared to almost 960,000 the Monday after the 2019 legislative
election. Other reforms include measures to lower the number of invalid or
spoilt votes among absentee/mail ballots, by re-designing mail ballot
instructions and introduction of "easy language" (or plain language) on them.
High fines and a prison sentence of up to two weeks will be introduced for
election commission members who deliberately leak election results of their
polling stations to the media or other third parties before poll closing time.
The reform of the voting law, which takes effect on 1 January 2024, was also
supported by the three opposition parties SPÖ, FPÖ and NEOS, after several
amendments were made to satisfy these parties too. The reformed election
law[27] was approved by the _Nationalrat_ (National Council) on 31 January
2023 and by the _Bundesrat_ (Federal Council) on 16 February 2023.[28][29]

## Statistics

[edit]

According to final numbers from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, a total
of 6,346,059 people are eligible to vote in the election. In the 2019
election, 6,396,812 people were eligible to vote. This means that the number
of eligible voters has fallen by 50,753 people. The reasons for this are that
the number of Austrian citizens has been falling for years due to a birth
deficit and negative migration balance to abroad, which is not compensated for
by the number of naturalizations. The final number of eligible voters was
published on 27 September 2024 after a period for objections and the
correction of the electoral rolls.[30]

Absentee/mail ballots will be sent to voters who requested them, starting at 2
September 2024. Early voting in every municipality will also be possible from
that day, by immediately casting absentee ballots there (after requesting them
at the municipal election department).[_citation needed_]

A total of 1,436,240 absentee ballots have been issued by the electoral
authorities all over Austria ahead of the election, with 27 September 2024,
the last possible day to request one. The number is a new record and much
higher than the 1,070,933 ahead of the 2019 election. In total, about 23% of
all eligible voters requested an absentee ballot, compared to 17% in 2019. It
is expected that every fourth vote cast in total in this election will be an
absentee ballot.[31]

## Contesting parties

[edit]

Any party that intends to be on the ballot for the election must submit a
statement of candidacy, its candidate list, a filing fee of €435 and either
the signatures of three members of the Austrian National Council, or
sufficient petition signatures of eligible Austrian voters by 1 August 2024 at
17:00 at the federal election commission in the Austrian Interior Ministry. To
be on the ballot in all nine states, 2,600 signatures are required, with
individual states requiring between 100 and 500 signatures. Parties contesting
the election in only some states only need to reach the signature threshold
for those states.

## Campaign

[edit]

All major parties started their election campaigns in mid-to-late August 2024.
First waves of election billboards and campaign posters were placed at heavily
frequented places and roads, lead candidates appeared in TV interviews and
discussions and ads on social media, radio and TV were launched. Each party
can spend a maximum of 8.6 million euros for the election, in accordance with
campaign finance laws.[_citation needed_]

Especially after the 2024 Vienna terrorism plot in early August 2024, in which
the Islamic State unsuccessfully tried to target concerts of the American
singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, the campaigning shifted heavily towards
security and policing issues, how to tackle political and extremist Islam in
Austria and on immigration and the integration of (primarily Muslim)
immigrants in Austria.[33] The focus on these topics were reinforced by the
2024 Solingen stabbing in late August 2024 in neighboring Germany, with the
FPÖ calling for "zero asylum" in Austria, increased deportations of criminal
foreigners to their home countries and a new law to ban political/extremist
Islam in Austria, similar to Austria's anti-Nazi law[34] in its campaign
program titled "Fortress Austria".[35] The FPÖ also called for enshrining
legal recognitions of binary genders in the constitution,[36] restoring some
political powers from the European Union to Austria,[35] ending sanctions
against Russia and Austria's exit from the European Sky Shield Initiative. The
FPÖ also heavily emphasised Remigration, particularly to Islamic countries,
during its campaign.[37]

The SPÖ and the ÖVP both attacked Herbert Kickl, with its leaders describing
him as "a threat to democracy" and a "security risk". Both parties pledged not
to join a government led by the FPÖ, although Karl Nehammer has not ruled out
forming a coalition with the FPÖ that would exclude Kickl from the
cabinet.[38]

The FPÖ's use of the term _Volkskanzler_ (People's Chancellor) to describe
Kickl in its campaign material has caused criticism among some Austrians for
its usage by Adolf Hitler in the 1930s and as a reminder of the FPÖ's origins
as a party founded by former Nazis in the 1950s.[39]

The ÖVP campaigned on a platform of stability.[40] It also pledged to
implement tighter immigration laws and tax cuts.[21]

According to experts from Foresight (ex-SORA), about 90 percent of the 1.436
million requested absentee ballots will be returned for counting. Of those
roughly 1.3 million ballots, the vast majority (roughly 1.1 million, or 85%)
would be counted on 29 September, while an estimated remaining 15% or 160,000
late-arriving absentee ballots would be counted – by law – on 30 September and
an additional 40,000 (from another district than the voters' own) would be
counted – by law – on 3 October.[41] Reports of polling stations throughout
election day suggested that overall turnout was "very high" and could reach
"80 percent or more".[42]

## Aftermath

[edit]

Celebrations broke out among FPÖ supporters after initial projections showed
them winning a plurality of votes. FPÖ general secretary Michael Schnedlitz
said "the men and women of Austria have made history today", while Herbert
Kickl called on other parties to reconsider forming a coalition with his
party. In response, Karl Nehammer reiterated that the ÖVP would not enter into
a coalition with the FPÖ unless Kickl was excluded from a ministerial
position.[43][44] Nehammer also said he was "bitter" over the ÖVP failing to
win but acknowledged his role in improving the party's showing following low
opinion ratings.[35]

A protest was held outside the Austrian Parliament Building in Vienna by
around 300 people protesting against Kickl on 29 September, calling him a
"Nazi".[35] The leaders of far-right parties across Europe, including
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán,[45] Marine Le Pen of the National Rally
in France,[46] Matteo Salvini of the League in Italy,[47] Santiago Abascal of
Vox in Spain,[48] Geert Wilders of the Party for Freedom in the Netherlands,
and Alice Weidel of the Alternative for Germany, sent congratulations to Kickl
and the FPÖ.[35]

In the first poll after the election, Market-Lazarsfeld for Ö24 found that the
FPÖ was supported by 30%, the ÖVP by 25%, the SPÖ by 20%, NEOS by 11%, the
Green Party by 8%, and others by 6% of voters. A plurality of voters preferred
a coalition by FPÖ-ÖVP (29%), followed by ÖVP-SPÖ-NEOS (23%), ÖVP-SPÖ-Greens
(12%), ÖVP-SPÖ (9%), FPÖ-SPÖ (9%), other coalitions (3%), and 15%
undecided.[49] Another new poll after the election by Unique Research for
Heute found that 58% of Austrians want the Austrian president to officially
task the FPÖ with forming the next government, while 36% were opposed. Among
FPÖ voters, 98% were in favour, among ÖVP voters the support was at 54%, and
44% were opposed. Among all other party voters, opposition outweighed
support.[50]

### Government formation

[edit]

President Alexander Van der Bellen pledged to ensure the formation of a
government that respects the "foundations of our liberal democracy".[51]
Although it is a convention that the president first asks the leader of the
largest party to try to form a government, the constitution does not require
them to do so.[52] Van der Bellen previously stated that he might not give FPÖ
this mandate in the event of their victory.[53] On 2 October, the outgoing
ÖVP-Green government tendered its resignation, although it was asked to stay
on in a caretaker role by Van der Bellen. The president then started official
talks with all party leaders on 4 October, with FPÖ leader Kickl being the
first to talk with the president. Van der Bellen and Kickl made no statements
after their meeting but Kickl said he would do so on 5 October.[54] Nehammer
and other ÖVP governors expressed support for the FPÖ receiving the first
mandate to form a government, citing a wish to preserve the convention.[55]

The president spoke with Nehammer (ÖVP) and Babler (SPÖ) on 7 October, and
with Meinl-Reisinger (NEOS) and Kogler (Greens) on 8 October. A meeting also
took place between Nehammer and Babler on 8 October.[56] After these initial
talks with each party leader, Van der Bellen said he asked the party leaders
to "sort things out on their own" until 18 October rather than tasking the FPÖ
with the mandate to form the next government. Van der Bellen said that the
situation is unique in the sense that no other party wants to cooperate with
the FPÖ and it would be ludicrous to order the FPÖ to form the government in
this situation. Instead, Van der Bellen ordered the parties to keep talking
with each other until a credible path to a government appears, after which he
would task the leading party of this constellation to form the next
government. Meanwhile, the FPÖ rose to a new high of 33% in a new Market-
Lazarsfeld poll for Ö24, with the ÖVP at 26% and the SPÖ falling below 20%
(19%) for the first time, NEOS at 10%, and the Green Party at 7%, KPÖ at 2%,
and others at 3%.[57]

After the FPÖ-ÖVP-SPÖ talks concluded on 16 October, Nehammer reiterated his
opposition to a government with Kickl, who insisted to lead the next
government himself as Chancellor. Nehammer said "Kickl is unable to govern",
adding that he was a "security threat for the country" and that "Nehammer and
the ÖVP are not willing to be the stirrup holders of Kickl and the FPÖ". On
the other hand, Kickl called Nehammer "an offended and aggrieved sore loser,
whose main goal is to continue clinging to power, but without the interests of
the country and voters in mind".[58]

On 22 October, Van der Bellen officially asked Nehammer to form the next
government and negotiate with the SPÖ.[59] Van der Bellen said that it was
clear that Kickl "would not be able to find a coalition partner who would make
him Chancellor", while Nehammer said that he would need to find a third
coalition partner to ensure a stable parliamentary majority. In response,
Kickl criticised Van der Bellen for breaking with the "tried and tested normal
processes" of asking the leading party in the election to form a government
and pledged that "Today is not the end of the story".[60]

On 25 October, Nehammer and the ÖVP officially launched first exploration
talks with Babler and the SPÖ. Nehammer also talked with NEOS and Green
delegations in the evening, because the ÖVP-SPÖ coalition would only have a
majority of one seat in the National Council, leading Nehammer to find a third
coalition partner. After the talks, Nehammer said the "road to a new
government will be long and stony" because of the "massive policy differences
between the parties involved."[61]
