Snap general elections were held in Sint Maarten on 19 August 2024,[1]
following the early dissolution of the parliament elected in January.[2]

## Background

[edit]

Following the January 2024 general elections a four-party government was
formed by the Unified Resilient St. Maarten Movement (URSM), the Democratic
Party, the Party for Progress and Nation Opportunity Wealth (NOW), all of
which had won two seats.[3] As the URSM received the most votes of the four,
its leader Luc Mercelina became prime minister.[4] Elected members took office
on 10 February 2024,[5] and Mercelina took the oath of office on 3 May.[6]
However, the government collapsed 18 days later when NOW MP Kevin Maingrette
resigned from his party and left the coalition to join the opposition. This
crossing the floor cost the coalition its majority, leading Mercelina to
dissolve parliament and call snap elections.[7] However, on 27 May, Maingrette
withdrew his support for the opposition and expressed support for the
Mercelina administration again despite still sitting as an independent.[8]
However, the elections remained scheduled.[9] On 2 July, Maingrette announced
he would not seek re-election,[10] and on 12 July was arrested and his house
scheduled to be searched following possible involvement in bribery prior to
his time as an MP.[11][12][13]

## Electoral system

[edit]

Per the Constitution of Sint Maarten, the number of members in the Estates is
determined by the following scale, dependent on the population:[14]

  * ≤60,000: 15
  * 60,001 to 70,000: 17
  * 70,001 to 80,000: 19
  * 80,001+: 21

As the population was estimated to be 41,349 as of 1 January 2024,[15] the
number of mandates to be contested in this election is 15. The members are
elected by open list proportional representation (first using the Hare quota
then D'Hondt method for any seats still unallocated) for a four-year
term.[16][14] The voting age is 18, and candidates standing must be a resident
of the island, a Dutch national, 18 years of age or older, and must not have
been disqualified from voting. Elected members may not stay outside the
country for more than eight months, or their mandate lapses, and must not be
the spouse or a second-degree relative of another member. In order to
participate in the election, new parties and parties without a seat in
parliament are required to obtain at least 144 signatures; 1% of the valid
votes of the prior elections (in this case the January 2024 general
elections).[16][17]

## Aftermath

[edit]

Theoretically, the original coalition formed following the election in January
between the URSM, DP, PFP, and NOW would still have enough seats for a
majority (obtaining 9 in total, an increase of 1 over the previous election)
if they wished to continue under the prior agreement. However, on 22 August,
it was announced that the URSM, DP, PFP, and SAM had agreed to form a
governing coalition,[19] with Mercelina likely returning as prime minister.

On 6 September, Governor Ajamu Baly appointed Mercelina as formateur. He is
due to report on the formation process by 15 November.[20]
