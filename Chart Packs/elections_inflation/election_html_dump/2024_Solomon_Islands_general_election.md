General elections were held in Solomon Islands on 17 April 2024 to determine
the composition of the 12th Parliament.[1][2] Initially planned for 2023,
parliament voted in 2022 to delay the elections. Prime Minister Manasseh
Sogavare claimed the country could not afford to have an election in the same
year the Solomon Islands were hosting the Pacific Games. The opposition
condemned the delay and accused Sogavare of a power grab.[3]

A major campaign issue included the country's ties with China; however,
domestic issues were a primary concern amongst many voters, including the cost
of living, the national debt and medicine shortages. Eight parties and ten
independents won seats. Prime Minister Sogavare's Ownership, Unity and
Responsibility Party (OUR) won the most seats, securing 15, but fell short of
a majority. The opposition Coalition for Accountability, Reform and
Empowerment (CARE) bloc, made up of the Democratic Party, Democratic Alliance
and the Umi for Change Party, won a combined 13 seats. Another opposition
party, the United Party (UP), secured six seats.

After the election, the OUR Party established the Coalition of National Unity
and Transformation with the Kadere and People First parties. On 29 April,
Sogavare announced he would not seek another term as prime minister in the 2
May parliamentary vote. The coalition nominated Foreign Minister Jeremiah
Manele in his place, while CARE, UP and the Solomon Islands Party for Rural
Advancement (SIPRA) selected Matthew Wale. Manele went on to defeat Wale, with
the support of most of the independents.[4]

## Background

[edit]

The previous election, held in 2019, took place following amendments to the
electoral act in 2018, which introduced additional measures to prevent
electoral fraud, including stricter penalties for candidates and voters
engaging in bribery and the implementation of a campaign blackout the day
before the election to deter vote-buying.[5] However, the maximum campaign
budget for candidates saw a rapid increase from SI$50,000 to SI$500,000,
resulting in cases of lavish campaign spending.[6] Results showed no party
obtained a majority as in previous elections. Of the eight parties that
secured seats, the Solomon Islands Democratic and Kadere parties emerged as
the largest; both won eight. Independents won the other 21 seats.[7]

With no dominant party, two blocs formed to compete to take the reins of
government. Manasseh Sogavare, who had previously served three non-consecutive
terms as prime minister, two of which ended in no-confidence votes, refounded
his Ownership, Unity and Responsibility Party (OUR) shortly after the
election.[8][9] The OUR Party, along with the Kadere, People First and
Democratic Alliance parties, formed the Democratic Coalition Government for
Advancement (DCGA) bloc[10] with Sogavare as the DCGA's nominee for prime
minister. On the other hand, the Solomon Islands United Party, Solomon Islands
Democratic Party and the United Democratic Party formed the Grand Coalition;
Matthew Wale was the bloc's prime ministerial nominee.[9] Wale challenged
Sogavare's eligibility to serve as prime minister in court, claiming he was
ineligible as he registered his party after the election, in breach of the
electoral act.[11][12] The High Court suspended Parliament's vote for prime
minister shortly before it was to occur on 24 April, having issued an
injunction.[13] However, citing the constitution, Governor-General Frank Kabui
ordered the vote to proceed.[14][15] In response, Wale and the Grand Coalition
boycotted the vote while the remaining members elected Sogavare prime
minister.[16] Wale then became leader of the opposition.[14] Sogavare's return
as prime minister resulted in riots in Honiara, stemming from public
frustration over the lack of citizen involvement with government
formation.[17][18] The High Court later dismissed the case against Sogavare's
eligibility to run for prime minister.[11] The OUR Party saw numerous MPs join
after the election, and by November 2019, the party had attained a comfortable
majority of 32 seats.[19]

### 2021 unrest

[edit]

Main article: 2021 Solomon Islands unrest

In November 2021, protests broke out in Honiara near parliament. Sogavare's
government withdrew Solomon Islands' recognition of Taiwan in 2019 and
established diplomatic ties with China. The switch faced condemnation by the
opposition and the provincial government of Malaita, which maintained de facto
relations with Taipei, increasing tensions between Sogavare and Malaita
Premier Daniel Suidani. Many protesters were from Malaita province and
demanded Sogavare's resignation due to the decision to pursue ties with
Beijing, along with other factors, including allegations of the central
government ignoring the public on issues including infrastructure. When
Sogavare did not address the demonstrators, riots broke out. Police attempted
to disperse the crowds by firing tear gas while the government imposed a
36-hour lockdown in the capital.[20] Demonstrators defied the curfew and took
to Honiara's Chinatown.[21] Numerous businesses and a police station were
burnt down,[20] resulting in three deaths. Once the rioting ceased, military
personnel and police from Australia, Fiji, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea
were deployed to help restore order.[21] Opposition Leader Matthew Wale called
for Sogavare to do "the honourable thing and resign" and announced he would
file a no-confidence motion if the prime minister refused. Sogavare resisted
calls to step down and blamed interference from unnamed foreign powers for the
riots, stating, "I don't want to name names…we know who they are".[20] Wale
subsequently introduced a no-confidence motion, which Parliament voted on in
December 2021. During the debate, Sogavare claimed the "innocent people of
Malaita have been lied to by these agents of Taiwan" and described the riots
as an "attempted illegal coup". Sogavare survived the no-confidence motion
with 32 MPs voting to keep him in office.[22]

### Security pact with China

[edit]

In March 2022, the DCGA government signed a security pact with China, which
permits Solomon Islands to request the deployment of Chinese military
personnel to assist the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force in restoring order
in the event of a similar incident to the 2021 protests and riots. In such a
scenario, Chinese personnel would also protect Chinese-owned businesses,
nationals and diplomats.[23][24] The full details of the pact were not made
public.[25] Reportedly, a part of his "friends to all, enemy to none" foreign
policy, Prime Minister Sogavare believed that the pact would benefit Solomon
Islands by providing the country with more stability, which would attract more
investors and result in further development. The opposition condemned the
agreement, claiming it would provide more leverage for Chinese influence that
would undermine Solomon Islands' democracy. They pledged to repeal it if they
were to oust the DCGA government at the election. Two groups, Transparency
Solomon Islands and Solomon Islands Council of Women, claimed the pact would
not represent the public's interests, that it would effectively cede the
country's sovereignty to China and condemned its alleged lack of holistic
consultation with Solomon Islanders. Australia, Fiji, Japan, the Federated
States of Micronesia, New Zealand and the United States voiced concerns with
the pact. These countries, along with others in the region, also feared how
the agreement might allow China to establish a military base in Solomon
Islands, which both Honiara and Beijing denied.[23][24] The pact prompted the
United States to re-open an embassy in Honiara in 2023.[26]

## Electoral system

[edit]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Solomon_Islands_House_of_Parliament_%28inside%29.jpg/250px-
Solomon_Islands_House_of_Parliament_%28inside%29.jpg)Chamber of the National
Parliament

The governor-general must schedule a general election to take place within
four months of the dissolution of parliament. The nomination period commences
the day after the announcement of the election date and concludes 42 days
before the poll. The period for campaigning begins on the day of the
proclamation of the polling date and ceases the day before the election.[27]
The 50 members of the National Parliament are elected in single-member
constituencies using first-past-the-post voting. Candidates are required to be
at least 21 years old and resident in the constituency they contest.
Disqualifications included holding dual citizenship, being executives or
members of the Electoral Commission, having an undischarged bankruptcy, being
imprisoned for more than six months, or being under a death sentence.[28] The
2018 electoral act raised the non-refundable nomination fee from SI$2000 to
SI$5000 in an attempt to lower the number of candidates, especially "shadow
candidates" who ran with the sole purpose of splitting votes to benefit other
contestants. The electoral commission argued that with fewer candidates, the
victor would gain a more decisive mandate.[7] Candidates running as a member
of a registered political party are not permitted to change their affiliation
after the confirmation of their nomination; unless they withdraw and file
their candidacy again.[27]

### Voters

[edit]

Voters must be at least 18 years old and hold Solomon Islands citizenship.
Individuals disqualified from voting include those that have committed a
breach of the electoral law, been declared insane, been imprisoned for more
than six months, or were under a death sentence.[28] The 2018 electoral act
introduced pre-polling, open to polling staff and police officers that are to
provide security for voting centres on election day.[29] In early February
2024, the chief electoral officer of the election commission, Jasper Highwood
Anisi, announced that citizens abroad on election day, including seasonal
workers in Australia and New Zealand, would be unable to vote as absentee
voting would not occur. Around the time of the 2024 election, there were no
provisions for overseas voting. Anisi said seasonal workers would possibly be
able to vote from abroad in future elections.[30][31] A total of 420,185
citizens were registered to vote in this election.[32]

### Election postponement

[edit]

In September 2022, the Sogavare government passed a bill in parliament,
delaying the dissolution of the 11th Parliament, which was due to occur on 19
May 2023, by several months to 31 December, to enable the postponement of the
2023 general election to 2024.[33][34] As Solomon Islands were hosting the
Pacific Games in 2023, Sogavare said the election delay was necessary, arguing
the country could not afford to hold two major events in the same year as it
was still recovering from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2021
unrest.[35] Many citizens were reportedly sceptical about the intentions
behind the delay, which also raised fears of unrest.[36] A survey conducted by
Transparency Solomon Islands from 31 March to 1 April 2022 found that 83% of
the 2,178 respondents from the public opposed the deferral.[37] The opposition
denounced the postponement as anti-democratic and a "power grab". Opponents
also criticised how the government had rushed the bill through parliament,
evading the regular procedures that allow for public input. Opposition Leader
Wale said the prime minister had "succeeded in making [Solomon Islands] the
laughing stock of the region, as a country that is prepared to tamper with its
own constitution for a two-week event, against the clear wishes of its
people".[36][3] Sogavare claimed the postponement would not threaten the
democratic process and said opponents to the bill lacked evidence that it was
undemocratic.[35] An electoral amendment bill passed by parliament on 14
December 2023 arranged for the national election to occur on the same day as
the provincial and Honiara City Council elections,[38] marking the first joint
elections in Solomon Islands since independence. The only two provinces not to
schedule provincial elections for 2024 were Choiseul and Western,[39] which
held elections in 2022.[40] On 26 January 2024, the electoral commission
scheduled the election for 17 April.[1]

## Schedule

[edit]

Acting Governor-General Patteson Oti confirmed the election date in a formal
announcement on 20 February. The following day, the campaign period and the
candidate nomination process commenced, with the latter concluding on 6 March.
The deadline for candidates wishing to withdraw was set for 8 March by the
electoral commission.[41]

## Parties and candidates

[edit]

A total of 334 candidates were nominated to contest the election,[42] a
similar amount to the 332 in the 2019 election.[43] Only 21 contestants were
women, comprising 6% of all candidates, a slight decrease from 26 in 2019. Two
incumbent female MPs did not seek re-election.[44][45] Of all the candidates,
219 were affiliated with one of the 13 contesting parties, while the other 115
ran as independents.[46][44][47] The Solomon Islands Democratic Party and the
Democratic Alliance Party established an alliance before the election, named
the Coalition for Accountability, Reform and Empowerment (CARE).[48] Most
parties in the Solomon Islands tend to lack a consistent or cohesive
ideology,[49] instead focusing on one or more of the following: the policies
and personality of the party leader, religion, regional or tribal loyalty,
and/or familial ties.[50] This results in the parties being unstable and
membership fluid, with members of parliament switching parties being
common.[51]

Party  | Leader  | Candidates  | 2019 result  | Ref(s).

Votes (%)  | Seats

## Campaign

[edit]

Solomon Islands' relations and security pact with China were a significant
issue during the campaign. However, many voters were more concerned about
domestic matters, including medicine shortages in clinics throughout the
country, education, the poor quality of roads, the cost of living and the
national debt.[61][62] Transparency Solomon Islands head Ruth Liloqula
criticised the contesting parties for running campaigns "mainly based on
foreign policies" and called on them to give more attention to domestic
issues.[25]

### OUR Party

[edit]

On 8 February, the OUR Party launched a manifesto.[63] Party leader and Prime
Minister Manasseh Sogavare announced the OUR Party's five most prioritised
policies going into the election. The first was preserving social cohesion and
national unity to prevent ethnic tensions from rising, as in 2000. Enhancing
the nation's legal and governing systems to guarantee public safety was
another key priority, as was socio-economic growth; the party pledged to
utilise the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific, the
Solomon Islands Infrastructure Program and China's Belt and Road Initiative.
The OUR Party's fourth priority was national defence, security and trade; the
party sought to preserve relations with Australia and other traditional allies
while expanding ties with China as part of a "look north" policy. The fifth
key priority was development and land and resources empowerment.[52] During a
campaign rally in the Malaitan provincial capital of Auki, Sogavare delivered
a speech where he praised the Chinese political system and declared his
government's decision to switch diplomatic ties from Taiwan to China to have
"put Solomon Islands on the map". Sogavare also claimed that democracy leads
to moral decline and same-sex marriage.[64]

### CARE

[edit]

On 7 February, the Democratic Alliance Party (DAP), led by former Prime
Minister Rick Houenipwela and the Solomon Islands Democratic Party (SIDP), led
by Opposition Leader Matthew Wale, established the Coalition for
Accountability, Reform and Empowerment (CARE) to contest the election.[65]
Along with the DAP and SIDP, Umi for Change was also a member party of
CARE.[66] The CARE coalition released a manifesto on 14 February; issues it
highlighted include job creation, infrastructure investment, implementing free
education, decreasing the cost of living and creating 25,000 jobs over a four-
year period.[67][68] CARE pledged to implement a 15% pay rise for public
servants and enhance the nation's health services. The coalition also promised
to address medicine shortages in health establishments nationwide and to ease
the overburdened National Referral Hospital in Honiara by funnelling more
resources into provincial hospitals.[69] The coalition's leader, Matthew Wale,
criticised the Parliamentary Entitlement Commission (PEC), which oversees the
entitlements of parliamentarians, for its plans to implement a pay increase
for members of parliament. Pointing to issues such as the struggling economy,
the healthcare crisis and the poor quality of roads nationwide, Wale described
PEC's decision as a "slap in the face" to Solomon Islanders and announced
CARE's intention to replace the PEC with a High Salaries Commission; intending
to monitor the salaries of public servants and provide more accountability and
transparency.[70] Regarding foreign policy, Wale announced that CARE would
maintain a balanced engagement with foreign countries, including China and the
United States. Wale stressed the coalition would ultimately prioritise the
national interests of Solomon Islands and ensure that consultation with the
public would occur before making foreign policy decisions.[68]

#### Umi for Change

[edit]

The then-premier of Malaita Province, Daniel Suidani, formed the Umi for
Change Party (U4C) in 2022.[71] Suidani, a vocal critic of the Sogavare
government's switch of diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China and its
expansion of ties with the latter, was ousted as premier in 2023 after losing
a no-confidence vote, allegedly due to his opposition to the switch.[72]
Suidani explained that U4C is a successor to the Malaita Alliance for Rural
Advancement government, which he led as premier of Malaita.[73][74] The
Political Parties Commission approved U4C's registration on 9 January 2024;
the party subsequently launched a manifesto. One of U4C's key policies
included revoking the absolute legal immunity that public officials enjoy.
Suidani said this policy was necessary, citing numerous officials allegedly
"hiding behind the law" and "making reckless decisions on behalf of the
state." The party also pledged to address gender inequality and focus on
youth-related issues;[73][75] U4C aimed to establish an education program on
employment to decrease youth unemployment.[59]

### Kadere Party

[edit]

The Kadere Party focused on governance and economic transformation. General
Secretary Martin Housanau announced the party would focus on shifting Solomon
Islands' economy away from raw material production and into a value-adding
economy as part of an industrialisation redirection. The Party also advocated
for land law reform; Housanau claimed land issues were the most prominent
obstacles to economic development and argued: "There are three factors of
production in the economy, these are, capital, labour and land if any of these
three factors is absent, the economy will become stagnant and decline".[55]

### SIPRA

[edit]

The Solomon Islands Party for Rural Advancement (SIPRA), led by former Prime
Minister Gordon Darcy Lilo,[25] pledged to provide additional resources to
assist the anti-corruption commission. Lilo claimed that despite the passage
of an anti-corruption act, the government had taken little action in
combatting corruption and suggested the anti-corruption commission was under-
resourced.[57] The party also promised to assist small and medium-sized
businesses nationwide and invest in the agricultural, tourism and fisheries
sectors. Viewing small and medium businesses as key to economic recovery and
growth, Lilo cited the roles these businesses have played in numerous Asian
countries.[76] Like the UP and CARE, SIPRA called for a review of the security
pact with China.[25]

### United Party

[edit]

The Solomon Islands United Party (UP) launched its campaign on 7 March. A core
aspect of the UP's manifesto was unity in diversity; the party advocated for
developing a "real national identity" whilst preserving the ethnically diverse
nation's numerous cultural identities.[77] Party leader Peter Kenilorea Jr.,
son of the nation's first prime minister, Peter Kenilorea,[78] announced the
UP would re-establish ties with Taiwan while maintaining relations with China
and reviewing China's security deal.[54] The party also sought to preserve
relations with traditional development partners, although Kenilorea warned
that Solomon Islands should not hold them as the country's sole saviours.[79]
The UP called for a diversification of the economy and warned that the
country's reliance on limited income streams, especially logging exports, left
Solomon Islands vulnerable to external economic crises. Addressing issues
regarding critical infrastructure was another priority for the party,
particularly the poor state of the roads and bridges.[80]

## Allegations of foreign interference

[edit]

A week before the election, Russia's state-owned Sputnik news agency published
an article featuring anonymous claims that the United States and USAID were
planning an "electoral coup" in Solomon Islands, which were repeated by the
Chinese Communist Party newspaper _Global Times_. In response, US Ambassador
Ann M. Yastishock dismissed the allegations as "blatantly misleading claims
about the United States' engagement in the region."[81]

## Logistics

[edit]

In September 2022, the Australian government proposed to assist in funding the
general elections. The DCGA government initially criticised the offer and
accused the Australian government of foreign interference, alleging they
disclosed the offer occurred when parliament debated delaying the general
election to influence the opposition. Opposition MP Peter Kenilorea Jr.
denounced the DCGA government's response as "extremely unhelpful" and claimed
it was evidence of Sogavare attempting to hold onto power. Australian Foreign
Minister Penny Wong denied the allegation and pointed to Australia having
supported previous elections in the Solomon Islands.[82] Once parliament
approved the postponement, Sogavare announced that the government would accept
Canberra's offer.[83] The Solomon Islands government allocated approximately
SI$40 million to fund the national, provincial and Honiara City Council
elections. The Australian government contributed SI$55 million, while the New
Zealand government provided SI$35 million. The overall budget was SI$130
million.[84]

On 25 March 2024, New Zealand announced that it would deploy the Royal New
Zealand Navy vessel HMNZS _Canterbury_ to transport two helicopters and crew,
along with command and maintenance personnel, to the Solomon Islands as part
of a NZ$10.8 million ($6.48 million) support program for the Solomon Islands
Electoral Commission agreed upon in January that would help transport election
officers and materials across the archipelago.[85] In addition to the New
Zealand personnel, police officers and soldiers from Australia, Fiji, and
Papua New Guinea were also deployed to assist the Royal Solomon Islands Police
Force in providing security. Chinese police would help with training
officers.[86][61]

## Conduct

[edit]

Pre-polling was held on 5 April in Honiara for electoral officials and police
officers providing security for polling stations on election day.[87] On 8
April, Home Affairs Minister Christopher Laore announced that election day
would be a public holiday to ensure a smoother electoral process. Laore also
declared that a ban on the sale of liquor would be in place from 16 to 26
April, mandating the closure of liquor shops, nightclubs and bars during this
period, except for licensed restaurants and hotels.[88] The ban was later
extended to 15 May on account of the prime minister's election and the
formation of a new government.[89] An emergency was declared at the country's
main hospital due to shortages of staff who went to vote.[81]

On election day, polling stations were open from 7:00 to 16:00. Voters waiting
in line at closing time were still allowed to vote.[90][91] More than 1,000
polling stations were opened nationwide,[92] while around 6,780 election
officials were involved, which was twice that of 2019 as the parliamentary
election also coincided with elections for eight out of ten provincial
assemblies and the Honiara City Council for the first time. Voting was
reportedly peaceful and went without violence.[93] Counting of ballots began
on 18 April.[81][94][95]

## Results

[edit]

On 24 April, the chair of the Solomon Islands Electoral Commission (SIEC),
Teasi Sanga, officially declared the election concluded.[96] Final results
released showed that no party gained a majority in Parliament, prompting
negotiations to form a governing coalition. Prime Minister Sogavare's OUR
party attained a plurality of 15 of the chamber's 50 seats,[66] however, 18 of
the party's incumbent MPs lost their seats, including Police Minister Anthony
Veke, and no newcomers from the party were elected.[49][97] The CARE coalition
secured 13 seats, and the UP won six (with one member elected as an
independent aligning with them after the elections, increasing the party's
seat count to seven).[98] The remaining seats went to smaller parties and
independents. Sogavare himself was narrowly re-elected in his seat of East
Choiseul[99][100] and claimed the United States had attempted to unseat
him.[101] Three women were elected; one, Freda Soria Comua, was an incumbent,
while the other two were newcomers.[102]

Thirty-nine pre-poll ballot papers from three constituencies in Isabel
Province were reportedly not counted during the election counting
process.[103] Chief Electoral Officer Jasper Highwood Anisi said that a review
on the election would be completed.[104]

### Local results

[edit]

In Malaita Province, former Premier Daniel Suidani, who was removed from his
position following a no-confidence vote in the Provincial Assembly in 2023,
was re-elected, while his successor, Martin Fini, lost his seat.[106] A few
disturbances were recorded in the province and were blamed on supporters of
losing candidates.[107] Three women were elected to the provincial assemblies
in Temotu, Malaita, and Isabel, while two women were also elected to the
Honiara City Council.[102]

## Aftermath

[edit]

### Government formation

[edit]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_Jeremiah_Manele_during_78th_session_of_the_UN_General_Assembly_%28cropped%29.jpg/230px-
Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_Jeremiah_Manele_during_78th_session_of_the_UN_General_Assembly_%28cropped%29.jpg)Jeremiah
Manele was elected prime minister after his predecessor, Manasseh Sogavare,
declined to seek another term

Negotiations to form a government reportedly began the day before the
election.[108][109] Following the election, the OUR Party and the opposition
began efforts to win over the ten kingmaker independents. Sogavare claimed the
opposition parties faced divisions in who to field for prime minister.[100]
CARE coalition Leader Matthew Wale, UP Leader Peter Kenilorea Jr., and former
Prime Minister Gordon Darcy Lilo emerged as potential candidates to take on
Sogavare for prime minister.[109] On 26 April, Sogavare announced that the OUR
Party had renewed an alliance with the People First Party, giving the bloc 18
seats, claiming it had enough support to form a government. However, he did
not name other coalition partners.[98] On 27 April, CARE signed a coalition
agreement with the UP, increasing the alliance's seat count to 20.[110]

Governor-General David Vunagi announced on 29 April that a parliamentary vote
to elect the prime minister would take place on 2 May.[89] The OUR Party and
People First Party were later joined by the Kadere Party, forming the
Coalition of National Unity and Transformation[111] (later the Government of
National Unity and Transformation, GNUT).[112] Shortly before nominations for
the prime ministerial election opened, Sogavare announced on 29 April that he
would not stand for another term as prime minister and resign as the OUR Party
leader, which he said was a "collective decision". The bloc instead nominated
Foreign Minister Jeremiah Manele, who also succeeded Sogavare as leader of the
OUR Party.[113][111] The CARE coalition, along with the UP and SIPRA,
nominated Matthew Wale for prime minister.[114] Before the prime ministerial
election, Manele's coalition claimed to have secured the support of the
independents, providing the bloc with 28 seats.[115] Prime ministerial
elections in Solomon Islands are often unpredictable, as MPs are not legally
barred from switching parties. Another factor is the vast difference in income
and benefits between government MPs and the opposition.[113] Ruth Liloqula,
the chief executive of Transparency Solomon Islands, claimed many MPs were
changing affiliation, motivated by personal and political gain rather than by
policies and principles. She highlighted how many of the newly elected
independent MPs had campaigned for a change in government, with some unseating
OUR Party members, only to join the party's coalition after the election.[116]
The elections for prime minister are conducted through a secret ballot.
Although it is held in the National Parliament, it is not a parliamentary
meeting and is presided over by the governor-general rather than the
speaker.[117] Manele won with 31 votes, defeating Wale, who earned 18. There
was one abstention.[118] Two members of Wale's bloc, Francis Sade of the UP
and Cathy Nori, defected to the GNUT and voted for Manele.[119] During the
first session of the 12th Parliament, on 16 May, Patteson Oti was re-elected
as speaker, while Sade was elected deputy speaker.[120] Wale assumed another
term as opposition leader.[121]

#### New Cabinet

[edit]

Following the election of Manele as prime minister, there were two swearing in
ceremonies for the new cabinet. Eleven ministers were sworn in on 4 May,
followed by a further nine on 6 May. Sogavare was appointed minister of
finance and treasury,[122][123] while Bradley Tovosia became deputy prime
minister.[124] The cabinet lineup was completed on 15 May, when the final
minister was sworn in.[125]

## Reactions

[edit]

Following his election, Manele called on citizens to refrain from post-
election violence, urging to "respect and uphold the democratic process of
electing our prime minister and set an example for our children and their
children".[126]

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese congratulated Manele on his
election as prime minister and said he looked forward to working closely with
him.[127] Papua New Guinean Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso visited Manele on
3 May where he presented a congratulatory letter behalf of Prime Minister
James Marape. Rosso also emphasised Papua New Guinea's commitment to
maintaining close ties with Solomon Islands.[128] A New Zealand delegation led
by Foreign Minister Winston Peters congratulated Manele during a visit to
Honiara on 12 May.[129] India's high commissioner to Solomon Islands,
Inbasekar Sunaramuthi, congratulated Manele on behalf of the Indian
government. Sunaramuthi also announced India's plans to sponsor infrastructure
projects in Solomon Islands.[130]
