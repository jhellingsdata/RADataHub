Snap legislative elections were held on 10 March 2024 to elect members of the
Assembly of the Republic to the 16th Legislature of Portugal. All 230 seats to
the Assembly of the Republic were up for election. The elections were called
in November 2023 after Prime Minister António Costa's resignation following an
investigation around alleged corruption involving the award of contracts for
lithium and hydrogen businesses.[1]

No party achieved an absolute majority of seats, with the centre-right
Democratic Alliance (AD) led by Luís Montenegro winning 80 seats, closely
followed by the Socialist Party (PS), which lost the absolute majority it had
gained in the 2022 elections, and was reduced to 78 seats. The election also
saw the surge of the right-wing populist Chega party as the third-largest
party in parliament, more than quadrupling its previous seat count to 50
seats. Turnout in the election was at 59.9 percent, the highest since 2005,
and in Portugal alone, turnout rose to 66.2%, the highest rate since 1995.

The leader of the largest party, Luís Montenegro, would go on to form a
centre-right minority government ending nearly a decade of rule by the
Socialist Party.

## Background

[edit]

The Socialist Party (PS), led by Prime Minister António Costa, won an absolute
majority in the 2022 legislative election with 41 percent of the votes and 120
seats in the 230 seat Assembly of the Republic. The main opposition party, the
Social Democratic Party (PSD), got 77 seats and 29 percent of the votes, while
the populist party Chega (_Enough_) gained 12 seats and seven percent. The
Liberal Initiative (IL) were able to win eight seats and gather almost five
percent of the votes. The left-wing/far-left parties, the Portuguese Communist
Party (PCP) and the Left Bloc (BE), achieved one of their worst results ever
with four percent of the votes and six and five seats, respectively. PAN and
LIVRE were able to win just one seat each.[2]

António Costa's third government was sworn in on 30 March 2022. This
government was unstable and experienced several scandals and controversies. By
mid-2023, the government had seen the resignations of 11 secretaries of state
and two ministers.[3] The biggest scandal involved TAP Air Portugal and a
compensation payment to a government member, Alexandra Reis.[4] This case was
followed by a violent incident, in late April 2023, at the Ministry of
Infrastructure, between government staff members and an advisor to Minister
João Galamba regarding an alleged stolen laptop.[5] The deployment of the
Portuguese Secret Services in this case stirred a clash between Marcelo Rebelo
de Sousa, the incumbent president of Portugal, and Prime Minister António
Costa concerning the future of Galamba and the government itself.[6]

### Fall of the previous government

[edit]

Main article: Operation Influencer

On 7 November 2023, the Public Security Police and the Public Prosecutor's
office carried out a series of searches at the official residence of the Prime
Minister and other ministries, leading to the arrest of the Prime Minister's
chief of staff.[7] Costa was named as a suspect in a corruption case involving
the awarding of contracts for the lithium and hydrogen businesses, but denied
any wrongdoing.[8] He met President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa in the
Presidential Palace and announced his resignation shortly after, stating that
he would not run for re-election.[1]

The President heard all parties after Costa's resignation.[9] The Socialist
Party proposed a new cabinet led by President of the Assembly of the Republic
Augusto Santos Silva[10] or Governor of the Bank of Portugal Mário Centeno[11]
that would last until the end of the government's term in 2026, while all
opposition parties, except PAN, supported an early election.[12] The President
has the power to dissolve the Assembly of the Republic at their discretion;
they are not required to do so when a prime minister resigns.[13] President
Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, after meeting with the Council of State, dissolved
the assembly and called an early election for 10 March 2024.[14]

The Prime Minister's resignation was not made official immediately; it was
postponed until 8 December 2023, so that the State Budget for 2024 could be
approved by parliament.[15][16] This marked the first time a single party
majority government has not completed its full term in democratic
Portugal.[_citation needed_]

### Date

[edit]

According to the Portuguese Constitution, an election must be called between
14 September and 14 October of the year that the legislature ends. The
election is called by the President of Portugal but is not called at the
request of the Prime Minister; however, the President must listen to all of
the parties represented in Parliament and the election date must be announced
at least 60 days before the election.[17] If an election is called during an
ongoing legislature (dissolution of parliament) it must be held at least after
55 days. Election day is the same in all multi-seat constituencies, and should
fall on a Sunday or national holiday. In normal circumstances, the next
legislative election would, therefore, have taken place no later than 11
October 2026.[18]

On 9 November 2023, President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa announced he would
dissolve the parliament and called an early election for 10 March 2024.[14] On
15 January 2024, the President signed the decree that officially dissolved
Parliament and set the date for the elections.[19] Campaigning officially
began on 25 February and lasted for two weeks.[20]

### Leadership changes and challenges

[edit]

#### CDS – People's Party

[edit]

In the 2022 elections, the CDS – People's Party was wiped out from Parliament
for the first time in 47 years of democracy.[21] CDS leader Francisco
Rodrigues dos Santos resigned on election night and announced that a
leadership ballot would be held.[22] On 11 February, it was announced that a
new leader would be elected in a party congress on 2 and 3 April 2022 held in
Guimarães.[23] MEP Nuno Melo, former MP Nuno Correia da Silva, 2016 leadership
candidate Miguel Mattos Chaves and Bruno Filipe Costa announced they would
contest the ballot.[24][25][26][27] During the congress, Bruno Filipe Costa
and Nuno Correia da Silva dropped out from the race.[28] Nuno Melo was easily
elected as leader with more than 77 percent of the votes. The results were the
following:

Ballot: 2 April 2022  Candidate  | Votes  | %   
---|---|---  
| Nuno Melo | 854  | 77.5   
| Miguel Mattos Chaves | 104  | 9.4

After the Social Democratic Party's (PSD) defeat in the 2022 legislative
election, Rui Rio announced he would resign and not run again for the PSD
leadership, calling a leadership election to elect a new leader.[29] The
ballot was held on 28 May 2022.[30] Luís Montenegro, former PSD parliamentary
group leader (2011–2018), and Jorge Moreira da Silva, former Environment
minister (2013–2015), were the only candidates on the ballot.[31] Around
45,000 party members, out of more than 85,000 active members, registered to
vote.[32] Montenegro defeated Moreira da Silva by a landslide, becoming the
19th leader of the party.[33] The results were as follows:

Ballot: 28 May 2022  Candidate  | Votes  | %   
---|---|---

General of the PCP

On 5 November 2022, the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) announced that
Jerónimo de Sousa, party leader since 2004, was departing from the leadership
for health reasons and the demands that the post requires.[34] The party chose
Paulo Raimundo, a party cadre and member since 1994, as new leader[35] whose
nomination was confirmed in a Central Committee meeting on 12 November 2022 by
unanimous vote, with one abstention, from Raimundo himself.[36] The results
were the following:

On 23 October 2022, party leader João Cotrim Figueiredo announced he was
leaving Liberal Initiative's party leadership and called a leadership
election.[37] Shortly after Cotrim's announcement, an MP Rui Rocha from Braga
constituency, stepped forward and announced his intention to run for the
leadership.[38] Two days later, Carla Castro, a Lisbon MP, also presented her
candidacy for the leadership.[39] A few weeks later, the party decided on a
date and location for the leadership ballot – the new leader would be elected
in a National Convention between 21 and 22 January 2023 in Lisbon.[40] A third
candidate for the leadership, José Cardoso, a critic of Figueiredo's
leadership and strategy, announced his candidacy on 2 January 2023.[41] Around
2,300 party members registered to vote in the leadership convention.[42] Rui
Rocha was elected as the 4th President of the Liberal Initiative with almost
52 percent of the votes.[43] The results were the following:

Ballot: 22 January 2023  Candidate  | Votes  | %

#### People Animals Nature

[edit]

People Animals Nature (_Pessoas-Animais-Natureza_ – PAN) held a leadership
ballot on 20 May 2023.[44] Two candidates were on the ballot: Incumbent leader
Inês Sousa Real and Nelson Silva, MP between 2019 and 2022. Silva accused
Sousa Real of leading the party to irrelevance and said that now it's time to
"save" and "rebuild" the party.[45] In a rather tense congress, with strong
accusations between both sides,[46] Inês Sousa Real was re-elected party
leader with 73 percent of the votes.[47] The results were the following:

Ballot: 20 May 2023  Candidate  | Votes  | %   
---|---|---  
| Inês Sousa Real | 97  | 72.9

Mortágua announcing her candidacy on 27 February 2023 in Lisbon

On 14 February 2023, party coordinator Catarina Martins announced she would
not run for another term as party leader.[48] Her reasons were that in the
party very long periods of leadership are not desirable and that the "new
political cycle" demanded a change. A party leadership convention was held
between 27 and 28 May 2023, in Lisbon.[49]

After MEP Marisa Matias and caucus leader Pedro Filipe Soares declined to run,
MP Mariana Mortágua decided to run for the party leadership.[50] Her candidacy
was confirmed on 27 February 2023.[51] A list of critics of the then party
leadership, led by former MP Pedro Soares [pt], opposed Mortágua in the
convention ballot.[52] On 28 May 2023, Mariana Mortágua was easily elected as
new party coordinator with 83 percent of the delegates' votes.[53] The results
were the following:

Ballot: 28 May 2023  Candidate  | Votes  | %

#### Socialist Party

[edit]

Main article: 2023 Portuguese Socialist Party leadership election

After the resignation of António Costa as Prime Minister on 7 November 2023,
following the Operation Influencer corruption investigation, and his
announcement that he would not run again for office, the Socialist Party (PS)
held a leadership election to elect a new leader[54] on 15 and 16 December
2023.[55] On 9 November 2023, former Minister of Infrastructure and Housing
Pedro Nuno Santos announced his candidacy for the party leadership,[56] while
Minister of Internal Administration José Luís Carneiro announced his intention
to run on the following day.[57] On 18 November 2023, Daniel Adrião, a member
of the National Commission of PS and candidate in the PS leadership elections
of 2016, 2018 and 2021, announced his candidacy.[58] On 16 December, Pedro
Nuno Santos was easily elected with almost 61 percent of the votes, compared
with 37 percent for José Luís Carneiro.[59] The results were the following:

### Electoral system

Boletim_de_voto_legislativas_Portugal_2024.pdf.jpg)Ballot paper for the 2024
legislative elections in Aveiro.

The Assembly of the Republic has 230 members elected for four-year terms.
Governments do not require an absolute majority support of the Assembly to
hold office, as even if the number of opposition MPs is larger than that of
its supporters, the opposition still needs to be equal to or greater than 116
(absolute majority) for both the Government's Programme to be rejected or for
a motion of no confidence to be approved.[60]

The number of seats assigned to each constituency depends on the district
magnitude.[61] The use of the d'Hondt method makes for a higher effective
threshold than certain other allocation methods such as the Hare quota or
Sainte-Laguë method, which are more generous to small parties.[62]

The distribution of MPs by constituency for the 2024 legislative election is
the following:[63]

Constituency | Number of MPs | Map   
---|---|---  
Lisbon | 48  | ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Portuguese_electoral_districts_2024.svg/220px-Portuguese_electoral_districts_2024.svg.png)  
Porto | 40   
Braga and Setúbal(+1) | 19   
Aveiro | 16   
Leiria | 10   
Coimbra, Faro and Santarém | 9   
Viseu | 8   
Madeira | 6   
Azores, Viana do Castelo(−1) and Vila Real | 5   
Castelo Branco | 4   
Beja, Bragança, Évora and Guarda | 3   
Portalegre, Europe and Outside Europe | 2   
  
### Early voting

[edit]

Voters were also able to vote early, which happened on 3 March, one week
before election day. Voters had to register between 25 and 29 February 2024 in
order to be eligible to cast an early ballot. By the 29 February deadline,
208,007 voters had requested to vote early, a number well below the 2022
figures.[64] On 3 March, 180,835 voters (86.9 percent of voters that
requested) cast an early ballot.[65]

## Parties

[edit]

For a more comprehensive list, see Party lists for the 2024 Portuguese
legislative election.

Parties and/or coalitions that intended to run had until 29 January 2024 to
file lists of candidates.[66] Eighteen parties and/or coalitions filed lists
to contest the election. The Social Democratic Party (PSD), CDS – People's
Party (CDS–PP) and the People's Monarchist Party (PPM) contested the election
in a coalition called _Democratic Alliance_ (AD). This coalition was on the
ballot in mainland Portugal and the Azores. In Madeira, the coalition was only
between PSD and CDS–PP, called _Madeira First_.[67] PPM ran alone in
Madeira.[68] The Communist Party (PCP) renewed their coalition with the Greens
(PEV), _Unitary Democratic Coalition_ (CDU), as has been the case since 1987.
The Earth Party (MPT) and Alliance (A) also contested the election under a
coalition called _Alternative 21_ (A21).[69]

Debate_com_todos_os_partidos_com_assento_parlamentar%2C_Fev.2024_%2853548399645%29.jpg)Debate
with parties seated in Parliament on 23 February 2024, broadcast by RTP1.

The issue of government formation after the elections was central during the
campaign, with the two major parties arguing over whether they would enable
the victor to form a minority government. The Socialist Party (PS) leader
Pedro Nuno Santos changed positions regarding the scenario of a Democratic
Alliance (AD) minority, with first being against it but, as the official
campaign started, expressed his openness to letting the AD govern. AD leader
Luís Montenegro, initially against the idea of letting the PS govern, also
changed his tone but speculation remained regarding his position.[84]
Healthcare and education were also crucial issues for voters, according to
surveys.[85]

In an interview with _Expresso_ on 8 March, President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa
said that he would do everything in his ability to prevent Chega from gaining
power, which drew criticism due to his position's mandate of neutrality.[86]
In a televised address on 9 March, Rebelo de Sousa called for people to vote,
citing the risk of economic problems caused by elections in the European
Parliament and the United States later in the year, and the ongoing conflicts
in Ukraine and the Middle East.[87]

Although economic indicators had been improving since 2014 – growth of 2.3
percent in 2023, well above the European average (0.5 percent), an
unemployment rate of 6.5 percent and public debt falling below 100 percent of
gross domestic product – discontent prevailed in Portugal, particularly due to
the lack of response to social issues. The country faced a housing crisis [pt]
and soaring rent prices, a deteriorating public health and education system,
shortages of teachers and doctors, very low wages and high inflation.[88]

a ballot, thus surpassing the 1980 record. In Portugal alone, turnout stood at
66.2 percent, an increase of more than eight percent compared with 2022, and
the best turnout share since 1995.[103]

## Results

[edit]

The final results of the election were released late on 20 March, when the
counting of overseas ballots that constitute four seats was concluded.[104]

In the closest legislative election in Portuguese history, the Democratic
Alliance narrowly won, gathering 28.8 percent of the votes and winning 80
seats.[105] The Alliance won all districts in the North Region and recovered
their support in strongholds such as the districts of Leiria and Viseu.[106]
During election day, AD issued a warning that many voters were casting ballots
for the National Democratic Alternative (ADN) due to confusion surrounding the
similar name and abbreviation on ballot papers.[107] ADN won more than 100,000
votes, with many considering that this confusion between the names may have
"stolen" seats from the Democratic Alliance.[108] The Socialist Party (PS) won
28 percent of the votes and 78 seats. Despite the narrow margin between the
Alliance and the Socialists, the PS fell 13 points and lost more than 40 seats
compared with the 2022 election.[105] On election night, leader Pedro Nuno
Santos conceded defeat and said that the PS would now lead the
opposition.[109]

Chega made large gains, winning 18 percent of the vote and receiving nearly
1.2 million votes.[110] The party also won 50 seats and received the most
votes in Faro district, the first time since the 1991 legislative election
that a third party won a district.[111] The Liberal Initiative (IL) held on to
their eight seats and their vote share from 2022, earning 4.9 percent of the
vote; however, the results were below the party's expectations.[112] The Left
Bloc (BE) also performed below expectations by retaining their five seats from
2022 and winning exactly the same vote share in 2022 at 4.4 percent.[113]

The Unitary Democratic Coalition (CDU), composed by the Portuguese Communist
Party and the Ecologist Party "The Greens", lost seats. The CDU won four
seats, a decrease of two compared with 2022, and just 3.2 percent of the
votes, their worst nationwide electoral performance to date.[114] The
coalition further lost their historic seat in Beja district; for the first
time under democratic rule, it also lost all MPs in the Alentejo region.[115]
LIVRE received almost the same number of votes as the CDU, winning 3.2 percent
of the votes, and electing four seats from Lisbon, Porto and Setúbal
districts.[116] People Animals Nature (PAN) held its sole seat, held by leader
Inês Sousa Real, and won 2 percent of the votes.

behalf of AD early on 11 March, while Pedro Nuno Santos conceded defeat on
behalf of his party.[118][119] Santos discounted the prospect of forming a
left-leaning coalition.[120] Minister of Finance Fernando Medina, who had been
considered as a possible replacement as leader of PS, said that the defeat was
due to the entire party and not Santos' leadership.[120] Chega's André Ventura
said that the results showed that the "two-party system in Portugal is
finished."[121] His party was congratulated by representatives of European
right-wing populist parties for its performance.[122] Montenegro reiterated
that he would not come to a political agreement with Chega.[123] President
Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who was a member of PSD prior to his election, met
with political parties between 14 March and 20 March, told _Expresso_ on 8
March that he would do what he could to prevent Chega from gaining power. His
remarks attracted criticism because the country's president is mandated to
remain neutral.[124]

Liberal Initiative leader Rui Rocha said that it was the responsibility of
other parties to lead the formation of a government, but that his party would
contribute as long as any proposals excluded Chega.[125] CDU leader Paulo
Raimundo blamed what he saw as misgovernance by the PS for the right-wing
gains in the election,[126] while PAN spokesperson Inês Sousa Real blamed
President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa in part for Chega's advances.[127] Mariana
Mortágua of the Left Bloc said that her party would either be a part of any
left-leaning coalition or oppose any right-leaning government,[128] and LIVRE
leader Rui Tavares expressed satisfaction that his party grew to four seats
and could form a parliamentary group for the first time.[129]

2024 in Lisbon.

Pedro Nuno Santos said in his concession speech that the PS would not vote in
favour of a motion of rejection of the AD government, although he also said
that "AD should not count on the support of PS to govern", implying that his
party would vote against the AD government's State Budgets.[120] André Ventura
said that Chega would vote against the State Budgets unless AD negotiated with
the party.[130]

On 21 March, Luis Montenegro was formally asked by President Rebelo de Sousa
to form a minority government[131] following the latter's consultations with
party leaders.[132] The final, certified election results were published in
the Portuguese official journal, _Diário da República_ , on 23 March
2024.[133] The new government was then presented and approved by President
Rebelo de Sousa on 28 March[134][135] and took office on 2 April.[136]

### 2025 budget crisis

[edit]

The lack of a workable majority means that the AD minority government is
forced to negotiate with Opposition parties to pass major legislation,
including the 2025 state budget.[137] The Government decided to start
negotiations on the budget with the Socialist Party (PS)[138] but the two were
at odds regarding corporate tax cuts and the "Youth IRS" scheme, which
provided an income tax rate cut for young people under the age of 35. The
Government refused to drop these two policies, while PS said that if they
remain in the budget, the party would vote against.[139] President Marcelo
Rebelo de Sousa warned that a lack of a deal would lead to snap legislative
elections,[140] and admitted he was indeed putting pressure on both the major
parties to reach some kind of deal.[141]

Luís Montenegro ultimately dropped several parts of his government's Youth IRS
scheme and corporate tax cuts proposals and adapted them to PS policies,
calling it an "irrecusable proposal" for the Socialists.[142] Pedro Nuno
Santos recognized the concessions made by the government, but pressed for more
conditions on corporate tax cuts, mainly on their timing.[143] Montenegro
rejected these last conditions made by PS, but said he was "confident" in the
budget being approved by Parliament.[144] A week later, on 17 October 2024, PS
leader Pedro Nuno Santos announced that the Socialist Party would abstain in
the budget vote, thus ensuring its approval with the votes of the AD
coalition. Though his conditions were not met, Santos justified the decision
with the desire to avoid a snap election less than a year after the previous
one, but stressed that the government is now "isolated" and "absolutely
dependent" on the opposition.[145] On 31 October, Parliament passed the budget
in its first general reading by a 80-72 vote, with the 78 PS members
abstaining. The final vote is expected for 29 November.[146]
