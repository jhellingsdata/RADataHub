Legislative elections were held in the Republic of China (Taiwan) on 13
January, 2024 for the Legislative Yuan of the Republic of China concurrently
with the presidential election.[1][2] This election was the fifth to use the
mixed electoral system after it was introduced to legislative elections.

The results saw the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lose its
majority in the Legislative Yuan that it had held since 2016, losing 11 seats
and retaining 51, while the Kuomintang (KMT) became the largest single party
with 52 seats, and the Taiwan People's Party (TPP) won eight seats. The New
Power Party lost all its three seats after failing to win a constituency seat
or meet the 5% threshold for at-large representation. The election marked the
first time under the current electoral system (introduced in 2008) that no
party held an absolute majority in the Legislative Yuan,[3] and the first in
which the largest party in the legislature won neither the most constituency
votes nor the most party votes. The term of the Legislative Yuan began on 1
February 2024.

## Electoral system

[edit]

Further information: Legislative Yuan elections in Taiwan

Members were elected by parallel voting. 73 members were elected by first-
past-the-post, 6 reserved for indigenous candidates by single non-transferable
vote, and 34 by party-list proportional representation.

## Contesting parties and candidates

[edit]

A total of 315 candidates registered for first-past-the-post seats in the 2024
legislative election.[4] Sixteen political parties submitted party lists to
the Central Election Commission (CEC). A total of 178 nominees were included
on party lists.[5] On 15 December 2023, the CEC announced that six first-past-
the post candidates, one candidate running for a reserved indigenous seat, and
one party list candidate, were ineligible.[6] The campaign period officially
started on 16 December 2023.[7]

Party  | General seats  | Aboriginal seats  | Party list  | Total   
---|---|---|---|---  
| Democratic Progressive Party | 69 | 2 | 34 | 105   
| Kuomintang | 64 | 4 | 34 | 102   
| Taiwan People's Party | 10 | 1 | 34 | 45   
| New Power Party | 2 | 0 | 8 | 10

**Total** | 309  | 19  | 177  | 505   
  
## Results

[edit]

The Kuomintang won 52 seats in this election, making it the largest single
party in the Legislative Yuan. The DPP, having won 51 seats, declined to the
second largest party in the Legislative Yuan. The Taiwan People's Party ranked
the third with 8 seats under its control. The DPP lost 11 seats in the
election, which also meant the loss of the parliamentary majority that it had
held since 2016. The election results also led to the removal of the New Power
Party, which previously held three seats, from the Legislative Yuan after it
failed to win a constituency seat or meet the 5% threshold needed to win at-
large seats. Two independents, namely Chen Chao-ming and Kao Chin Su-mei, who
were members of the Kuomintang caucus in the 10th Yuan, were also elected.[3]

The election was the first in Taiwanese history in which the party that
received the most votes did not win the most seats, and also marked the first
time since 2004 that no party held an absolute majority in the Legislative
Yuan.[3] This result that TPP therefore has the "kingmaker" position, it's
also meant that the TPP’s support was crucial in the selection of the
President of the Legislative Yuan and the major policies.[8]

The election was also the first time that an openly bisexual candidate,[9]
Huang Jie (DPP) of Kaohsiung city's sixth constituency, was elected to the
Legislative Yuan.[10] It was also the first time that an openly transgender
person, Abbygail ET Wu of the Green Party (at-large), ran for the chamber,
albeit unsuccessfully.[11]

## Aftermath

[edit]

At the opening of the new Legislative Yuan on 1 February 2024, Han Kuo-yu of
the Kuomintang was elected as President of the Legislative Yuan following two
rounds of voting in which all eight members of the TPP abstained in the second
round. Han obtained the support of the KMT's 52 members in the Legislative
Yuan as well as two independents[12] and defeated the DPP's You Si-kun and the
TPP's Huang Shan-shan. The KMT's Johnny Chiang was also elected as deputy
speaker, defeating the DPP's Tsai Chi-chang and the TPP's Chang Chi-kai.[13]
