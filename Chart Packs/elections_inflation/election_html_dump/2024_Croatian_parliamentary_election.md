Parliamentary elections were held in Croatia on 17 April 2024 to elect the
members of the 11th Sabor. Prior to the elections, the government consisted of
a coalition of the Croatian Democratic Union and Independent Democratic Serb
Party, with parliamentary support of five national minority MPs, two MPs from
the Croatian Social Liberal Party and Croatian Demochristian Party, and one
independent MP, Silvano Hrelja.

The ruling centre-right HDZ won a plurality of seats for the fourth straight
election obtaining a victory over the centre-left Rivers of Justice. The
right-wing populist Homeland Movement finished third, with the left-wing and
green We can! in fourth place. The HDZ subsequently formed a right-wing
coalition with the Homeland Movement and returned HDZ leader Andrej Plenković
as Prime Minister for a third term.[1]

## Background

[edit]

The pre-election period was marked by speculation about the possible date of
the election, potential coalitions and unification of the opposition, as well
as accusations of corruption and nepotism in the government led by Prime
Minister Andrej Plenković and his changes in ministers.

### Changes of ministers in the government

[edit]

Plenković's two governments were marked by many changes in ministerial
positions, a total of 30 ministers. Of its initial lineup in 2016, only Nina
Obuljen Koržinek (Minister of Culture and Media), the Deputy Prime Minister
Oleg Butković (Minister of the Sea, Transport and Infrastructure), and the
Deputy Prime Minister Tomo Medved (Minister of Croatian Veterans) remained.[2]
The Bridge ministers Vlaho Orepić (Minister of the Interior), Ante Šprlje
(Minister of Justice), and Slaven Dobrović (Minister of Environmental
Protection and Energy) were the first to leave the government. They were
dismissed by Plenković for refusing to reject the vote of no confidence in
Zdravko Marić (Finance Minister) requested by the opposition. Immediately
afterwards, fourth The Bridge member Ivan Kovačić (Minister of Administration)
resigned from the government, as did Pavo Barišić (Minister of Education) who
was facing accusations of plagiarism which were later dismissed by the
University of Augsburg.[2][3]

Scandals occurred in 2018, which began with the Borg affair that led to the
departure of Economy Minister Martina Dalić and her replacement by Darko
Horvat, who was incarcerated in Remetinec prison in 2022 after being charged
with illegally awarding 2.6 million Kuna.[2][3] Davor Ivo Stier (Minister of
Foreign Affairs) resigned after a disagreement with the party leadership, and
his successor Marija Pejčinović Burić left in 2019 after being elected
Secretary General of the Council of Europe. In 2019, five ministers left the
government following a series of scandals. Lovro Kušćević (Minister of
Construction and Spatial Planning) after it was found that he conducted
illegal real estate brokerage while he was the mayor of Nerežišća on Brač,
Goran Marić (Minister of State Property) resigned after a series of real
estate scandals. An indictment against Gabrijela Žalac (Minister of Regional
Development and European Union Funds) was brought for abuse of position and
authority in the "Software affair", and her name was also mentioned in the
Vjetroelektrana affair with Josipa Rimac. Tomislav Tolušić (Minister of
Agriculture) was mentioned in numerous scandals and was later indicted for
embezzlement with EU funds, including 2.5 million Kuna for his winery, which
he received under irregular circumstances.[3] Nada Murganić (Minister of
Demography, Family, Youth and Social Policy) was dismissed for unsatisfactory
performance.[2][4]

More controversies occurred in 2020, with Milan Kujundžić (Minister of Health)
leaving the government following a series of real estate scandal. Damir
Krstičević (Minister of Defence) resigned after the crash of a military
training plane in which two members of the Croatian Air Force died near
Biljana Donje near Zadar. He was replaced by Mario Banožić, who left after
committing manslaughter while driving irresponsibly.[2][3] Marko Pavić was
removed as Ministry of Regional Development and EU Funds, along with Gari
Cappelli (Minister of Tourism).[2] Vesna Bedeković was replaced as Minister
for Demography, Family, Youth and Social Policy by Josip Aladrović, who
himself was under investigation by USKOK and also resigned.[2][3] Nataša
Tramišak was replaced as Minister of Regional Development and European Union
Funds by Šime Erlić as part of Plenković's personal intentions. Ivan Paladina,
Minister of Spatial Planning, Construction and State Property, was removed due
to the slow pace of reconstruction after Zagreb and Petrinja
earthquakes.[2][3]

### Election date

[edit]

In 2023, it was reported that the HDZ was preparing to hold elections in April
2024, two months before the elections for members of the European Parliament.
From conversations with several high-ranking HDZ members, _Jutarnji list_
reported that that Andrej Plenković would collect advantages with which he
will go before the voters and ask for another prime ministerial mandate in the
next year, so that the elections can be held before the Easter holidays in
2024.[5]

On 28 February 2024, _Jutarnji list_ reported that HDZ planned to hold the
General Assembly on 17 March 2024 in the Vatroslav Lisinski Concert Hall in
Zagreb, three months before the deadline. Information subsequently began to
circulate that the Parliament could be dissolved on 22 March, the last day of
the 21st session of the Croatian Parliament, and the dissolution could be
voted on.[6] On 8 March, Plenković confirmed the dissolution of parliament on
14 March.[7]

On 14 March 2024, the Parliament unanimously voted to dissolve itself, without
specifying a date for the election.[8] The following day, president Zoran
Milanović announced that elections will be held on 17 April.[9][10] For the
first time, the election will be held on a Wednesday,[11] while the 2000
Croatian parliamentary election was held on a Monday.[12]

### Pre-election events

[edit]

The first pre-election coalition was agreed by The Bridge and Croatian
Sovereignists on 8 July 2023, with an open spot for other parties ranging from
the center to the right including the Homeland Movement.[13] Ivan Penava (DP)
did not decline the possibility but instead called for Most to join a
coalition with DP.[14] After that DP entered a short-lived alliance with the
Croatian Democratic Peasant Party on 16 December 2023.[15] On 27 March 2024,
DP concluded an agreement with Law and Justice, a party which emerged
following the unification of The Key of Croatia, Let's Change Croatia and
Independent list of Mislav Kolakušić.[16][17] On the other hand, Most and HS
decided to enlarge coalition with the Independent Youth List (NLM) on 22 March
2024.[18]

On 28 July 2023, a coalition was agreed between two liberal regional parties,
the Istrian Democratic Assembly and the Alliance of Primorje-Gorski Kotar,
with a main goal to represent Istria and Kvarner in VII and VIII electoral
districts. The coalition will also contest the 2024 European Parliament
elections.[19][20] Two more liberal parties, Focus and the People's Party –
Reformists announced their cooperation on 10 November 2023. The leader of the
Reformists Radimir Čačić said that with a high level of certainty they expect
a large expansion of this cooperation with parties close to them, who believe
that Croatia is institutionally and as a society trapped by the HDZ, and that
this should be stopped and space should be opened for a different, much more
modern, more liberal Croatia.[21] Finally two groups made one single alliance
on 9 December 2023. Four party leaders: Davor Nađi (Focus), Dalibor Paus
(IDS), Radimir Čačić (NS-R) and Darijo Vasilić (PGS) pointed out that they are
running against the HDZ and that after the elections they will not participate
in the government with the HDZ, although Čačić did not rule out the
possibility of supporting a minority government.[22] On 5 March 2024, the
coalition was formally constituted under the name "For Better Croatia".[23]
The coalition later collapsed after Focus decided to ally with the Republic
party of Damir Vanđelić, while the Reformists still partnered with IDS and PGS
in VII. and VIII constituencies and with the Rivers of Justice coalition in
other constutuencues.[24][25]

Social Democratic Party dissidents led by Davorko Vidović as leader of Social
Democrats made an agreement with the Croatian Peasant Party on 7 October 2023,
creating the "Our Croatia" (Croatian: _Naša Hrvatska_) coalition.[26] Ten days
later Croatian Labourists – Labour Party joined coalition emphasizing this is
just continued cooperation and trust.[27] On 2 March 2024, the Democrats
joined the coalition, claiming that they recognized the great potential for
positive change as well as the courage and ability to gather broadly on the
left and center.[28] HSS left the coalition on 5 March 2024 and joined the
Rivers of Justice on 22 March 2024.[23][29] On 27 March 2024 "Our Croatia"
announced a deal with the IDS, PGS and the NPS in III, VII and VIII electoral
districts.[30]

The most anticipated coalition of the 2024 election was an alliance of the
main opposition party Social Democratic Party of Croatia and left wing
contender We can! (Možemo!). Such an idea was seen as probable because of
similar policies of the parties. We can! announced on 27 June 2023 that it
would run separately, leaving the possibility after the election to form a
government with parties of the center to the left, including the SDP.[31] On 1
March 2024, Sandra Benčić (We can!) announced the start of negotiations with
the SDP on a "dotted coalition", which means a coalition in constituencies
where they do not have enough support individually. In that case, the
coalition would be implemented in IV., V., VII. and IX. electoral unit, while
in other units the parties would go separately.[32] On 22 March 2024 Možemo
and SDP announced that an agreement was not reached, which means that they
will go separately in all constituencies.[33]

On 17 February 2024, members of the left-liberal opposition held a protest
under the name "Enough! Let's Go to the Elections!" (Croatian: _Dosta je!
Odmah na izbore!_). The protest was organized by SDP, We can!, Centre, IDS,
HSS and RF, Focus, SD, NS-Reformists, GLAS, and SsIP. The reason for the
protest was the appointment of Judge Ivan Turudić as the Attorney General. The
day before, the same parties submitted a request for the dissolution of
parliament and the holding of early elections. Most and HS joined them with
signatures even if they did not participate in the protests.[34][35] The next
protest was held on 23 March 2024 simultaneously in Zagreb, Split, Rijeka,
Osijek and Varaždin.[36]

On 5 March 2024, a large left-liberal future coalition named For a Better
Croatia was announced after an inter-party meeting. The coalition will be led
by the SDP with Peđa Grbin as prime ministerial candidate and will include
Focus, NS R, PGS, IDS, Centre, HSS, Glas, RF, and SsIP**.**[23] On 6 March,
IDS and PGS claimed there will be no coalition in VIII electoral district with
other parties than Focus and NS-R, per previous agreements.[37] On 17 March,
Grbin announced that the Workers' Front would not be part of the coalition,
while the Istrian Democratic Assembly, Alliance of Primorje-Gorski Kotar and
Fokus left the coalition on 19 March, citing Milanović's candidacy, which is
not in accordance with the law, as the reason.[38][39][40] After the collapse
of the coalition, the remaining parties reached an agreement on going to the
elections under the Rivers of Justice coalition.[29]

Following the creation of the opposition coalition, HDZ announced that it
would cooperate with HSLS, HDS, HNS, and HSU in some electoral
districts.[41][42] Hours after announcing the election date on 15 March,
President Zoran Milanović announced at a press conference that he would be the
SDP's candidate for prime minister in the elections,[43] during which he would
run against incumbent prime minister Andrej Plenković in electoral district
I.[44] On 18 March, the Constitutional Court ruled that Milanović may not be a
candidate nor could he actively participate in support of the SDP during the
election campaign,[45] unless he resigns from the presidency of Croatia. In
response, Milanović described the ruling as "done in a gangster way".[46]
Ahead of the election, researchers from the Faculty of Political Science of
University of Zagreb have developed an online electoral compass test in
cooperation with Kieskompas, which positions the main political parties and
the user, based on a set of questions, on the political spectrum.[47]

## Electoral system

[edit]

Constituencies_of_Croatia_%282023-present%29.svg.png)Electoral districts in
use from 2023

The 151 members of the Croatian Parliament are elected from 10 geographical
and two special electoral districts:[48]

  * 140 seats are elected in ten geographical 14-seat electoral districts (1st–10th Electoral Districts) by open list proportional representation (using a 5% electoral threshold) with seats allocated using the d'Hondt method
    * A voter can give their "preference vote" to a single candidate on the list, but only candidates who have received at least 10% of the party's votes take precedence over the other candidates on the list.[49]
  * 3 seats are elected in a special electoral district (11th Electoral District) for Croatian citizens living abroad
  * 8 seats are elected from an electoral district for national minorities (12th Electoral District): 3 seats for Serbian, 1 seat for Italian, 1 seat for Hungarian, 1 seat for Czech and Slovak, 1 seat for Albanian, Bosniak, Macedonian, Montenegrin and Slovenian, and 1 seat for Austrian, Bulgarian, German, Jewish, Polish, Roma, Romanian, Rusyn, Russian, Turkish, Ukrainian and Vlach national minority 
    * Voters with the right to vote in the 12th Electoral District can choose to either vote for a candidate list on the ballot in the district they belong to according to their place of residence (one of the 10 geographical districts) or for a candidate of their minority in the 12th Electoral District.[50]

On 28 October 2022, the Constitutional Court issued a warning that it could
declare the next elections unconstitutional unless the electoral law was
changed, due to excessive differences in the number of voters for each
constituency, leading to significant variations in vote weight.[51] On 7
February 2023, the Constitutional Court repealed the electoral law because the
difference in vote weight between different electoral districts was too large
to comply with the constitutional provision that each vote must be of equal
weight.[52] Parliament passed a new electoral law on 20 October 2023, which
came into effect on 3 November, requiring the next elections to be held with
reorganized electoral districts.[53]

### Submission of candidate lists

[edit]

Lists for the election of representatives may be proposed independently by one
political party or by two or more political parties (coalition list) which are
registered in the Republic of Croatia on the day the Decision to call the
elections is announced, or by voters. Voters shall propose independent
candidate lists on the basis of validly collected 500 signatures of residents
of the Electoral District the list is running in.[54]

### Female representation

[edit]

It is required by the election law that each list running in the election
contains at least 40% of both men and women, to ensure equality. For the lists
that do not adhere to this rule, the State Electoral Commission (DIP) will
report them to The Ombudsperson for Gender Equality and the State's Attorney
Office of the Republic of Croatia (DORH) when the parties and candidates
proposing those lists can expect a fine of up to 33 000 euros.[57][58]

Thirty-two out of 165 lists did not respect the rule and will be reported. A
number of the main parties respected the rule and have at least six women and
men on all their lists, among them Focus/Republic (11 lists), MOST/HS (11), RF
(10), the Rivers of Justice coalition (10) and the Our Croatia coalition
(eight). On the other hand, the biggest offenders are HDZ, DP/PiP coalition
and MP Karolina Vidović Krišto's party OiP. For both HDZ and OiP, the fine
could be high as much as 60 000 euros all together. When asked about this,
Andrej Plenković responded: "There are many more women than 30, but the
circumstances are such that we have a lot of candidates, we try to balance it
... ."[59][60]

While We Can! holds the record for the most women holding the first place on
their lists (six constituencies), HDZ and DP/PiP have none.[61][62]

## Campaign

[edit]

The official political campaign started on 30 March with the DIP publishing
all of the valid lists. It will last until the end of 15 April as the election
silence is enforced. It starts at midnight and lasts until 7:00 pm on the
election day when the polling stations close and exit polls are
published.[63][64]

The campaign was marked by increased social media advertising and content
creation. Many politicians have, in order to appeal to young voters, joined
social media platforms like TikTok, among the most prominent ones being Prime
Minister Andrej Plenković and the Diaspora candidate Ljubo Ćesić Rojs. The
platforms are still being used mostly for critique, negativity and personal
attacks on opponents. Mass buying of bots, specifically HDZ's bot farms from
Vietnam, has come to light.[65][66][67][68][69] On April Fools' Day, We Can!
has introduced the first Croatian AI politician _Nitkolina_ (Nikolina being a
common name and "nitko" meaning "nobody") to fight fake news and
misinformation.[70]

### Issues

[edit]

On 12 January 2024, President Zoran Milanović publicly outed HDZ minister
Damir Habijan as gay.[71] It was the first case of outing a political opponent
as part of LGBT community without their approval in the political history of
the country. The situation caused a wave of reactions, but LGBT rights
organizations did not react and a rift was created between the activists of
the community.[72][73] In April, Zagreb Pride released a controversial list of
candidates running who are members of the community. The list of 11
candidates, mostly members of We Can!, included three incumbent HDZ officials
who either hadn't publicly announced their orientation before or didn't give
permission to be on the list, as well as two SDP candidates. Politicians like
Peđa Grbin (SDP) and Damir Vanđelić (Republic) condemned the list.[74][75]

During the campaign, Zoran Milanović voiced his plan to form a broad "national
salvation" coalition government of all parties except the currently governing
HDZ. He also urged voters to vote for anyone except HDZ.[76][77] The Bridge
stated that they will form a government with any party which accepts their
program and PM candidate Nikola Grmoja. Unlike SDP, We Can! strongly rejected
participating in a government with the Most or DP, saying they are the only
barrier to the right in government. In case of a gridlock in government
formation after the election, they are ready to provide confidence and supply
to an SDP minority government from Sabor, with the condition that the right
does the same and doesn't enter the new cabinet.[78][79] Ivan Penava stated
that We Can! and SDSS are unacceptable as partners for the Homeland Movement,
but not SDP.[80]

During a campaign rally in Split, Andrej Plenković criticized Zoran Milanović,
who has espoused supportive stances on Russia, for "pushing Croatia and the
Croatian people into the ‘Russian World’". He also compared the Russian
invasion of Ukraine to Serbian aggression against Croatia in the 1990s.[81]
The numerous political corruption scandals within the government have weakened
the HDZ campaign. Some thirty ministers have had to leave the government in
eight years because of corruption.[82] The scandal involving private WhatsApp
messages of former HDZ official Josipa Rimac with the new State Attorney of
Croatia Ivan Turudić, that were one of the causes of the 2024 Zagreb protest,
continued during the campaign and this time involved the HDZ Minister of
Maritime Affairs, Transport and Infrastructure Oleg Butković. In April,
several previously unreleased sets of leaked messages were published by
Faktograf.hr that apparently testify to some dubious actions and deal-making
by Rimac, involving suspicions of lobbying, influence peddling and nepotism.
Butković denied remembering contacts with Rimac.[83][84][85] In the messages,
Rimac also criticized the former Conflict of Interest Commission presidents
Nataša Novaković and Dalija Orešković.[86][87]

Unlike in 2016[120] and 2020,[121] the leaders of two biggest parties, HDZ and
SDP, did not attend a single debate. Peđa Grbin challenged Andrej Plenković to
one, but Plenković refused to debate Grbin, as the PM candidate of Rivers of
Justice is Zoran Milanović. The Prime Minister refused to debate other
political opponents, saying that he doesn't have anyone to debate with. DP
leader Ivan Penava and PM candidates Nikola Grmoja (Most) and Sandra Benčić
(Možemo!) also challenged Plenković to a debate. Grbin, Grmoja and Benčić all
suggested Plenković is afraid and/or called him a
coward.[122][123][124][125][126] To the calls to debate them, Plenković
responded by saying: "This is a political match in which Grbin capitulated
before the formal campaign, Milanović violates the Constitution, and a
political trifle, like Most, is not someone we would confront (in a debate)."
Plenković, Grbin and Penava all skipped the big HRT debate, while Grmoja and
Benčić attended.[127]

## Results

[edit]

The election produced a fourth consecutive victory for the governing HDZ;
however, the opposition parties denied it a one-party majority in the Sabor.
The official results showed that HDZ's coalition won 61 seats, almost 20 seats
more than the second placed Rivers of Justice coalition whose 42 candidates
were elected.[129] Despite HDZ's plurality of votes, in order to form a
governing majority, they still required to rely on forming a coalition, with
the most likely partners the third-placed far-right party, the Homeland
Movement, which won 14 seats.[130] The Homeland Movement therefore has the
kingmaker position,[130] although it declined to say whether they would join a
left-leaning or right-leaning bloc and setting the condition that they will
not enter into a coalition with SDSS and Možemo.[131]

Among the other opposition parties, conservative The Bridge along with
partners Croatian Sovereignists won 11 seats, and the green-left We Can! who
won 10, both declared after the vote they intended to start talks with
potential allies aimed at putting together some form of majority
administration.[132] The latter party also encouraged all smaller parties
regardless of political leanings to come to an agreement in order to oust HDZ
from power. The Workers' Front failed to achieve the 5% electoral threshold,
leaving the party without a representative in the Sabor.[133]

## Aftermath

[edit]

Andrej Plenković claimed victory on behalf of the HDZ and said that it would
begin the process of forming a new parliamentary majority to form the HDZ's
third government on 18 April 2024. He also congratulated other contesting
parties.[129] SDP leader Peđa Grbin said that they had hoped for a better
result but said that they would also start talks on the formation of a new
government on 18 April.[135] During negotiation talks, the DP was labeled the
kingmaker of the election.[136][137]

On 19 April, the Constitutional Court ruled that President Zoran Milanović was
ineligible to become prime minister in the event that the SDP would be able to
form a government, citing his statements and behavior during the electoral
campaign. According to the ruling, he would be barred from being given the
mandate to form a new government even if he previously resigned as
President.[138] Three of the Constitutional Court judges released a dissenting
opinion pointing out there are no specific arguments or regulations to justify
the decision. They cited "unconstitutional threats" of the Court and
criticized the potential undermining of the will of the people.[139] Milanović
gave a statement in front of a photo showing "HDZ's man" Miroslav Šeparović,
the Court's President, hanging out together with HDZ ministers Oleg Butković
and Branko Bačić, accusing the Court of preparing a coup d'état.[140][141]

As one of the scenarios for the formation of a new government, Grbin presented
the idea of an anti-corruption government. This would imply the constitution
of a Parliament in which, at least temporarily, the majority will be all
opposition parties (Možemo!, Rivers of Justice, IDS, Fokus, Most, and DP).
Such a parliamentary majority could pass several important laws, including the
electoral one, as well as annul the appointment of State Attorney Ivan
Turudić. After that, in the event that the parties could not agree on the
formation of a joint government, new elections could be held.[142]

On 21 April, elections were repeated in two polling stations. The first was in
Sračinec, where an excess of ballots was found in the ballot boxes. The
irregularity referred to the list of candidates in the XII electoral unit
where representatives of the Albanian, Bosniak, Montenegrin, Macedonian and
Slovenian national minorities were elected. The second polling station was in
Markušica, where it was discovered that by mistake 83 persons of Serbian
nationality voted twice, namely for the V electoral unit and for the
candidates of the XII electoral unit of the Serbian national minority.[143]

On 27 April, the DP held negotiation talks with both the HDZ and SDP, with
Prime Minister Andrej Plenković announcing that the HDZ would form a formal
coalition with the DP some time in "the coming days."[144]

On 29 April, the State Electoral Commission published the final results,
setting a deadline to 19 May for holding the first session of the Sabor with
president Milanović deciding the exact date.[145]

On 5 May, an agreement was reached on the HDZ and DP government, with
Plenković as prime minister. DP will receive three ministries, demography,
agriculture, and energy, which will be separated from the Ministry of
Economy.[146] Members of the Serb community were excluded from the new cabinet
due to opposition from the DP.[147] On 10 May Plenković submitted 78
signatures of representatives at a meeting with president Milanović at the
Presidential Palace, after which Milanović gave him a mandate to form the
government. The signatures were given by 61 representatives of the HDZ
coalition, 12 representatives of the DP, four representatives of minorities
and Vesna Vučemilović, who was subsequently expelled from the Croatian
Sovereignists.[148] The Sabor issued its approval of the new government in a
79-61 vote on 17 May.[149]
