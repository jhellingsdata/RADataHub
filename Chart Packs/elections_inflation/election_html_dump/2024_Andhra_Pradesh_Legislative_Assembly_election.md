## Election issues

[edit]

In the lead-up to the election, several issues have come to light, including
demands for special category status, the capital issue and unemployment in the
state.[23] Incidents such as Y. S. Vivekananda Reddy’s murder, the attack on
Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy[24] and legal cases against N. Chandrababu Naidu have
also gathered significant attention.[25] Despite facing anti-incumbency, the
YSR Congress relies on its welfare schemes, particularly in rural and tribal
areas. Meanwhile, the NDA focuses on concerns such as inflation, unemployment
and broader development, gaining support in urban areas.[26][27]

### State capital

[edit]

Main articles: 2019–2024 Amaravati protests and List of capitals of Andhra
Pradesh

During the previous five-year tenure of the TDP-BJP government, Amaravati was
proposed as the capital for the state of Andhra Pradesh.[28] However, this
plan was later scrapped by the successive YSRCP government, which aimed to
establish three capitals namely Visakhapatnam, Amaravati and Kurnool as
executive, legislative and judiciary purposes respectively, as part of a
decentralisation initiative which faced legal hurdles and failed to be
implemented.[29] While farmers in the Amaravati region opposed this decision,
the TDP-JSP-BJP alliance vowed to reinstate Amaravati as the
capital.[30][31][32] On the contrary Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy
launched _Vision Visakha_ , reaffirming the establishment of Visakhapatnam as
the administrative or executive capital.[33][34]

### Alcohol prices and quality

[edit]

In the previous 2019 election, the YSRCP made a promise to completely ban
alcohol in the state. However, it was not fulfilled and instead, prices were
increased with the aim of reducing consumption.[35] The TDP-JSP alliance,
along with the BJP alleged that this led to what they termed as the nation’s
largest liquor scam, with significant financial and health implications for
consumers, including the risk of liver diseases.[36][37] The Alliance has
pledged to provide good-quality alcohol at reduced prices, claiming that
distilleries and breweries are controlled by members and associates of the
ruling party, including those producing local brands with poor-quality.[36]
The Alliance leaders also alleged that despite the nationwide shift towards
digital transactions, liquor retail outlets in the state have continued to
accept cash payments exceeding the Maximum Retail Price (MRP), thereby
generating profits for leaders of the ruling party.[38][39]

### Illegal sand mining

[edit]

The joint committee formed by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate
Change, submitted a report to the National Green Tribunal on 21 March 2024,
revealing ongoing 24-hour illegal sand mining in the inspected regions of
Krishna and Guntur districts without valid environmental clearances.[40] The
committee was formed in response to petitions alleging illegal sand mining in
the state. Additionally, the committee noted that the state government failed
to provide information and documents requested from the Department of Mines
and Geology regarding district-wise sand reaches allotted, permitted
quantities, and violations.[41][42][43] Opposition parties have accused ruling
party leaders of illegally transporting thousands of lorries of sand daily,
with no action taken despite numerous complaints lodged by opposition leaders
and local residents.[44]

### Naidu's arrest

[edit]

TDP supremo N. Chandrababu Naidu was arrested on 9 September 2023 in an
alleged multi-crore skill development scam.[45] The arrest became an election
issue in Telangana, which was then soon to enter state polls, with different
political parties in the state rushing to support Naidu to woo Andhra
settlers.[46] Naidu's son Nara Lokesh said that Naidu's arrest was unfair and
alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi did the same with firms in Gujarat
while he was the state chief minister there.[47]

### Land Titling Act

[edit]

The Land Titling Act of Andhra Pradesh has become a major issue in the
elections, leading to counterclaims and allegations between political parties
in the state. The act was brought by the Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy government,
aiming to streamline land records, settle disputes and provide permanent
titles. Both the Telugu Desam Party and Jana Sena Party have termed it as the
Land Grabbing Act.[48][49] The main opposition party, TDP chief N. Chandrababu
Naidu, alleged that the act was designed to take away lands and promised to
revoke it if they come to power. He also questioned Chief Minister Jagan for
printing his image on the passbook instead of the official emblem of the
state.[50][51] The YSRCP alleged that the TDP is spreading misinformation
about the Land Titling Act due to losing confidence in their manifesto.
Furthermore, the state government countered the TDP's claims by stating that
the Centre has encouraged state governments to enact their own legislation
based on drafts proposed by NITI Aayog to suit their requirements.[52][53]
While the BJP, part of the NDA alliance said that the Centre has no authority
to enact the land related legislations.[54][55] The opposition parties within
the NDA alliance claimed that this act is in contravention of the laws related
to property transfer, evidence, succession and various judicial proceedings,
citing violations of property laws and Article 300-A, along with concerns
about Title Registration Officers.[56][57][58][59]

## Campaigns

[edit]

2024 Election - Street campaign through song and dance by NDA in Guntur,
Andhra Pradesh

Candidates campaigned by interacting with common people and participating in
their daily activities such as making tea, ironing clothes and weighing
vegetables.[60] The primary parties in the state used movies and songs to
promote their own political party while denigrating other party leaders. The
use of social media to amplify the reach of such content to voters had become
a core strategy for parties.[61]

### YSR Congress Party

[edit]

The YSRCP launched its _Why AP needs Jagan_ campaign on 9 November 2023. The
outreach campaign would last for 40 days. Bus yatras will also be taken out in
all 175 assembly constituencies during the campaign. The campaign has been
criticised by the opposition TDP, which countered the campaign with the slogan
_Why AP hates Jagan_.[62]

Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy announced a mass contact program called
_Siddham_ (We are Ready!) for the election campaign,[63] which was countered
by the slogan _Samsiddham_ (We are Prepared!) and _Memu Siddhame_ (We are also
Ready!) from the TDP and JSP respectively.[64] The YSRCP has taken up the
slogans _Maa Nammakam Nuvve Jagan_ (Jagan is our belief) and _Jagananne Maa
Bhavishyattu_ (Jagan is our future) to reach the public for the upcoming
election.[65][66] The party has finalised and announced candidates for all 175
seats in the upcoming general election through multiple lists.[67]

### National Democratic Alliance

[edit]

After huge speculation about an alliance between the TDP and Janasena Party
(JSP), JSP chief Pawan Kalyan officially announced the tie of both parties in
the 2024 polls on 14 September 2023 amidst the arrest of N. Chandrababu Naidu
to collectively fight against the incumbent YSRCP.[68][69] A joint action
committee was setup, comprising representatives from both parties.

The first meeting of the committee was held in Rajahmundry on 21 October 2023,
addressing public issues, the latest political developments and steps for
better coordination between the two parties.[70][71] Both the TDP and JSP
chiefs met on multiple occasions to discuss seat sharing, a common manifesto
and other political developments in the state.[72][73]

On 20 December 2023, to mark the completion of the Nara Lokesh _Yuva Galam
Padayatra_ , the TDP and JSP held a joint public meeting called _Yuva Galam
Navasakam_ in Polipalli, Vizianagaram district, accommodating around 6 lakh
people with Pawan Kalyan attending the meeting.[74][75][76][77][78]

The initial joint list of the TDP-JSP alliance, comprising a total of 118
seats, was formally released by both party chiefs on 24 February 2024. Of
these, 24 seats were allotted to the JSP, with 5 candidates named and 94 seats
to the TDP.[79] On 28 February 2024, both parties held a joint public meeting
called _Jenda_ in Tadepalligudem, West Godavari district, describing it as a
historic necessity to defeat the incumbent YSRCP. They emphasized the
importance of saving democracy and promoting the development of Andhra
Pradesh, urging party cadres to understand the ground reality.[80][81]

On 9 March 2024, the president of the Bharatiya Janata Party, J. P. Nadda
issued a joint official statement on behalf of the BJP, TDP and JSP. The
statement announced the admission of the TDP to the NDA and finalised the
alliance of the BJP, TDP and JSP for the upcoming legislative assembly and Lok
Sabha polls in Andhra Pradesh.[82][83]

The alliance members have agreed to contest all 175 seats with TDP in 144, JSP
in 21 and BJP in 10. The alliance has finalised the candidates through
multiple lists.

#### Telugu Desam Party

[edit]

The TDP organised various public outreach programs such as _Badude Badudu_ ,
_Isuka Satyagraha Deekshalu_ and _Jaiho BC_[84][85] to engage with the public
and campaign against the YSRCP.[86][87][88] The TDP general secretary Nara
Lokesh also launched the _Yuva Galam Padayatra_ , a walkathon to reach the
public.[89]

#### Janasena Party

[edit]

Earlier to the official formation of the alliance with the TDP, the JSP chief,
Pawan Kalyan launched a _Varahi Yatra_ on 14 June 2023 from Annavaram with a
specially designed vehicle named as _Varahi_ to campaign against the
YSRCP.[90][91] The campaign was conducted in multiple phases to reach the
public widely.[92]

### Indian National Congress

[edit]

The Indian National Congress (INC) launched its campaign _Intinti Congress_
via a statewide door-to-door campaign on 20 January 2024.[93] The recent
successes of the INC in the bordering states of Karnataka and Telangana have
enthused the party cadre ahead of the state elections.[93][94] Chief Minister
Jagan Reddy's sister Y. S. Sharmila, joined the INC on 4 January 2024 and is
currently leading its campaign.[95][96]

On 22 February 2024, APCC president Y. S. Sharmila and other 40 Congress
workers were temporarily detained for protesting against the DSC notification
for teacher recruitment. Sharmila herself had reportedly spent the previous
night in the party office to avoid house arrest.[97]

On 26 February 2024, at Anantapur, Sharmila and Congress president Mallikarjun
Kharge announced a guarantee of ₹5,000 per month to every poor family if the
party comes to power. At the meeting, Kharge criticised prime minister
Narendra Modi for not according Special Category Status (SCS) to Andhra
Pradesh. He also said that the TDP, JSP and the YSRCP were all stooges of the
BJP.[98] On 1 March, Congress general secretary Sachin Pilot said at a public
meeting in Tirupati that the Congress would accord 10-year SCS to Andhra
Pradesh immediately if it came to power at the centre.[99]

## Manifestos

[edit]

### YSR Congress Party

[edit]

On 21 April 2024, the party's chief and the chief minister, Y. S. Jagan Mohan
Reddy, unveiled the party's manifesto at his camp office in Tadepalle,
promising to continue existing welfare schemes for the next five years if
voted to power.[100]

### National Democratic Alliance

[edit]

On 30 April 2024, both N. Chandrababu Naidu, the chief of Telugu Desam Party
and Pawan Kalyan, the chief of Jana Sena Party, unveiled a joint manifesto at
Undavalli, promising to create employment opportunities and implementation of
other welfare schemes.[101][102] The BJP, another alliance partner endorsed
the TDP-JSP joint manifesto without adding any further assurances as it had
already released its own manifesto previously titled "Modi Ki Guarantee".[103]

### Indian National Congress

[edit]

The Indian National Congress had released their manifesto titled "Nyay Patra"
previously for the general election in March 2024.

## Incidents

[edit]

### Electoral malpractices

[edit]

Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief N. Chandrababu Naidu accused the ruling YSR
Congress Party (YSRCP) of subverting electoral practices. Subsequently, on 28
August 2023, he lodged a complaint with the Election Commission of India to
ensure all the eligible voters are included and fake voters are removed. He
also demanded an enquiry into the transfer of the electoral data to the
private agencies and prevent the appointment of grama volunteers instead of
teachers for the election duty.[104][105] He also submitted a documentary
evidence of the deletion of 40,000 votes in Visakhapatnam East, 23,000 votes
in Vijayawada Central and also at Parchur, Tadikonda and Uravakonda
constituencies.[106][107]

### Stone pelting

[edit]

On 13 April 2024, a stone was thrown at Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy
by an unidentified person while he was campaigning on top of a bus in
Vijayawada.[108] The stone narrowly hit the left temple of his eye, avoiding
any major injuries and causing a minor cut.[109] While the YSRCP alleged that
it was a pre-planned conspiracy to attack their leader,[110] the opposition
leader, N. Chandrababu Naidu condemned the act and requested an impartial
inquiry by the Election Commission into the incident. Furthermore, the TDP
questioned the circumstances and timing of the incident, alleging that it was
staged and similar to the knife attack on Jagan weeks before the 2019 Andhra
Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, aimed at garnering sympathy for winning
the election.[111][112][113][114] Power was switched off during the incident
by authorities to prevent Jagan and others standing on top of the vehicle from
coming into contact with live wires and overhanging cables.[115] Various
politicians, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the attack.[116]

## Election day

[edit]

The election concluded with a high voter turnout of 81.86%. Darsi recorded the
highest turnout at 90.91%, while Tirupati had the lowest at 63.32%.[117] Post-
election violence erupted between members of the ruling YSRCP and the main
opposition TDP in few districts, particularly in Palnadu, Anantapur and
Tirupati. The clashes involved stick fights, stone-throwing, involving the use
of petrol bombs along with crude weapons such as sickles, axes and hammers.
This led to injuries, burning of vehicles and damage to party offices and
houses. The violence caused widespread fear and forced businesses to
close.[118] In response, the Election Commission of India has deployed Special
Investigation Teams to the affected regions for further investigation and has
suspended 12 Subordinate Police officers.[119][120][121]

YSRCP MLA, Annabathuni Siva Kumar hit a voter standing in a queue after the
voter objected to the MLA for jumping the queue. The voter retaliated by
hitting him back, after which the MLA's supporters also attacked the
voter.[122][123] Another YSRCP MLA, Pinnelli Ramakrishna Reddy, stormed into a
polling booth with his supporters and destroyed the EVM and VVPAT machines by
hitting them to the ground in Macherla.[124][125][126]

## Surveys and polls

## Results

[edit]

The results of the election were announced on 4 June 2024. The NDA, popularly
known as **_Kūṭami_** (lit. 'coalition'), achieved a sweeping victory securing
a total of 164 seats. The TDP won 135 out of the 144 seats it contested, JSP
secured all 21 seats it contested and the BJP won 8 out of its 10 contested
seats.[132][133] The incumbent YSRCP faced severe anti-incumbency and managed
to win only 11 out of the 175 seats it contested.[134][135] This result marked
the worst defeat in Andhra Pradesh's electoral history, with the YSRCP unable
to even secure the position of the opposition in the state.[136][137] The NDA
swept all districts except for the Alluri Sitharama Raju, causing the YSRCP to
lose many of its previously considered strongholds.[138][139][140][141] The
INDIA alliance failed to win any seats in this election.
