Translation_to_english_arrow.svg.png)| You can help **expand this article with
text translated fromthe corresponding article in Italian**.  _(October 2024)_
Click [show] for important translation instructions.

  *   * Machine translation, like DeepL or Google Translate, is a useful starting point for translations, but translators must revise errors as necessary and confirm that the translation is accurate, rather than simply copy-pasting machine-translated text into the English Wikipedia.
  * Consider **adding a topic** to this template: there are already 705 articles in the main category, and specifying`|topic=` will aid in categorization.
  * Do not translate text that appears unreliable or low-quality. If possible, verify the text with references provided in the foreign-language article.
  * You **must** provide copyright attribution in the edit summary accompanying your translation by providing an interlanguage link to the source of your translation. A model attribution edit summary is `Content in this edit is translated from the existing Italian Wikipedia article at [[:it:Elezioni regionali in Umbria del 2024]]; see its history for attribution.`
  * You may also add the template `{{Translated|it|Elezioni regionali in Umbria del 2024}}` to the talk page.
  * For more guidance, see Wikipedia:Translation.

The **2024 Umbrian regional election** will be held on 17 and 18 November
2024.[1]

## Electoral system

[edit]

The candidate who obtains a plurality of votes on a regional level is elected
President of Umbria and the winning coalition receives 60% of the seats in the
Legislative Assembly, i.e. 12 seats, excluding the seat reserved to the
president. All other candidates for president who have not been elected but
are linked to lists or coalitions that have elected at least one councillor
are automatically elected to the Legislative Assembly.

The allocation of seats by coalitions and lists takes place on a proportional
basis using a largest remainder method with open lists, with a 2.5% threshold
for all lists and with a maximum limit of 10 seats obtainable for a single
list.

Each candidate for president cannot spend more than €100,000, each candidate
for regional councillor cannot spend more than €25,000 and each list cannot
spend more than €1 multiplied by the number of inhabitants of the Region.[2]
