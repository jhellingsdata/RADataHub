General elections were held in Botswana on 30 October 2024 to determine the
composition of the 13th Parliament of Botswana as well as local councils
across the country. Up for election were 61 seats of the National Assembly as
well as 609 local council seats, all elected through the first-past-the-post
voting system.

The election saw the end of 58 years of single-party governance by the centre-
right Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), which had led the country since
independence in 1966. The BDP was decisively beaten by the centre-left
opposition Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC). Large voter swings toward
opposition parties led to the BDP falling to fourth place.[4][5][6]

The UDC took first place with 36 seats, a majority of five. This ensured Duma
Boko, leader of both the UDC and its largest component, the Botswana National
Front (BNF), would be elected as President of Botswana. The Botswana Congress
Party (BCP) took second place, becoming the official opposition.[7] The
Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) achieved significant growth in the Central
District, increasing its number of seats. The BDP was reduced to a rump of
four seats after nearly six decades of uninterrupted government.

Incumbent president Mokgweetsi Masisi conceded defeat on the morning of 1
November 2024 and ensured a peaceful transfer of power.[8] Later that day,
President Boko was sworn-in by Chief Justice Terence Rannowane, allowing him
to form the first government since independence with no BDP participation.[9]

## Background

[edit]

### Previous election

[edit]

Main article: 2019 Botswana general election

The election held on 23 October 2019, saw the BDP maintain its parliamentary
majority for the 12th consecutive time, securing 53% of the votes and 38 out
of 57 seats, one more than in the 2014 election. The UDC garnered 36% of the
votes and 15 seats, two fewer than its 2014 result. The election marked a
significant political realignment in Botswana's political landscape. This was
because the Central District (which had consistently supported the BDP,
averaging around 75% of the vote since the first elections in 1965) saw large
swings to the opposition due to former President Ian Khama's backing of the
newly-formed Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF) and of UDC candidates, where the
BPF did not stand candidates of its own.[10] The UDC and BPF won 11 out of 17
seats in the district, marking the first time ever that a party other than the
BDP won a seat in the district. Nonetheless, the BDP made substantial gains in
other regions, securing all seats in both Gaborone and districts in the
southern parts of the country, offsetting the UDC's advances.[11][12] The
election outcome described as an upset was attributed to President Masisi's
efforts to reconcile with segments of society previously at odds with Khama,
such as labour unions, whose support had waned in the 2014 election. The
rapprochement between the UDC leadership and Khama, who remains unpopular
among urban and southern voters, led to a loss of support for the UDC among
its traditional opposition base in the south.[11]

While international observers deemed the elections "free and fair,"[13] Duma
Boko contested the BDP's victory, alleging significant electoral
irregularities.[12][14] Despite the UDC's claims of multiple voting and
bribery of election officials, their petition to invalidate the results was
dismissed by the High Court in December 2019. Although the Court of Appeal
agreed to hear the case in January 2020, it was later dismissed for lack of
jurisdiction.[15]

### Background of opposition parties before the election

[edit]

Following the 2019 elections, there were three opposing parties in the
National Assembly—the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), the Botswana
Patriotic Front (BPF) and the Alliance for Progressives (AP). In August 2022,
the BPF joined the UDC alliance, uniting all opposition parties in the
National Assembly except for the AP.[16]

The Botswana Congress Party (BCP), a major member of the UDC since 2017, had
expressed interest in leaving the UDC alliance due to disagreements between
BCP leader, Dumelang Saleshando and UDC leader, Duma Boko.[17] Saleshando
ceased to be the Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, after a
group of UDC MPs joined by five BCP dissidents, voted him out of the position
in July 2022.[18]

The BCP proposed forming an electoral alliance with the AP and the newly-
formed, Botswana Labour Party (a minor Botswana National Front splinter
party).[19] However, the AP withdrew from the coalition talks after
disagreements with the BCP largely due to disagreements over constituency
allocation, opting to join the UDC instead.[20][21]

In May 2023, the BCP's central committee unanimously decided to participate in
the 2024 elections separately from the UDC alliance. The party cited concerns
over the UDC's disregard for intra-party democracy and the vulnerability of
their party leader to capture by "private interests", as reasons for their
exit.[22]

Following a party leadership retreat in April 2024, the BPF decided to leave
the UDC alliance, opting for a "pact model" which would see the BPF not
standing candidates in constituencies it deemed unwinnable and the UDC doing
the same in constituencies which the BPF can win in, instead of running under
the UDC—a proposal since rejected by UDC leadership.[23]

The election campaign also saw the return of former president Ian Khama, a
critic of incumbent president Mokgweetsi Masisi, after three years of self-
imposed exile in September 2024.[24] Khama supported the BPF in the
election.[25]

### Composition of parliament

[edit]

See also: 12th Parliament of Botswana

The 12th Parliament was inaugurated on 5 November 2019. Dumelang Saleshando
had replaced Duma Boko as Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly
following Boko's defeat at the general election.

Prior to the ban on floor crossings in 2023, the National Assembly saw two BDP
MPs and two UDC MPs defect to the UDC and BDP, respectively. A by-election was
triggered in the Serowe West constituency after Tshekedi Khama's expulsion
from parliament after he fled to South Africa with his brother (and former
President), Ian Khama, causing him to miss the minimum number of sessions
required to maintain his seat. The 2023 Serowe West by-election was held in
July 2023 and saw the BPF retain the seat at a larger majority. Yandani Boko,
former UDC MP for Mahalapye East, resigned from the National Assembly in March
2024. A by-election was not held for his seat as it was deemed too close to
the dissolution of parliament, expected by August.[26][27]

## Electoral system

[edit]

For the 2024 elections, the membership of the National Assembly consists of 61
MPs elected in single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting, six
members appointed by the governing party and two ex-officio members (the
President and the Speaker).[28]

Voters are required to be citizens of Botswana and at least 18 years old and
have been resident in the country for at least 12 months prior to voter
registration. People who are declared insane, hold dual citizenship, under a
death sentence, convicted of an electoral offence or imprisoned for at least
six months are not allowed to vote.[29] Candidates have to be citizens of
Botswana, at least 21 years old, without an undischarged bankruptcy and be
able to speak and read English sufficiently well to take part in parliamentary
proceedings.[29] They must also obtain a nomination from at least two voters
in their constituency and the support of seven. A deposit is required, which
is refunded if the candidate receives at least 5% of the vote in the
constituency. Members of the Ntlo ya Dikgosi (House of Chiefs) cannot stand
for election to the National Assembly.[29]

The president is indirectly elected for a five-year term by the National
Assembly. Since 1997, presidents are limited to a maximum of ten years in
office, whether consecutive or not.[30] The president's survival is dependent
on whether their government has the support of a simple majority of the
National Assembly MPs. He can be removed by a motion of no confidence,
prompting their resignation or if not, the dissolution of parliament if the
president refuses to do so.

During the general election campaign, each candidate must declare whom they
endorse for President when they lodge their nomination papers. The candidate
who garners the backing of an absolute majority of the total number of elected
MPs is automatically designated as president. If a party or alliance secures
an absolute majority in the legislative elections, its presidential candidate
becomes president without the need for an investiture vote. In practice, since
legislative elections are conducted through first-past-the-post voting, this
has been the norm, with Botswana always having majority governments ever since
independence in 1966.

In the event that no candidate secures a simple majority, the National
Assembly elects the president through an indirect, secret ballot, requiring a
simple majority of the total number of MPs (excluding 'specially-elected'
MPs). This election is limited to candidates who have the support of at least
10 MPs. If, after three rounds of voting, no candidate is elected, two
additional rounds may be authorized by the speaker, if it is deemed that a
successful election remains possible. Should these rounds also fail to produce
a winner, or if the speaker declines to authorize further rounds, the National
Assembly will be dissolved, and new elections will be held.

### Seat redistribution

[edit]

In accordance with section 64(1) of the Constitution of Botswana, a
Delimitation Commission was appointed on 13 May 2022 (following the release of
the decennial 2022 Botswana Census) to redistribute the constituencies of the
National Assembly. The National Assembly passed a bill increasing the number
of constituencies by four seats from 57 to 61 seats.[31] Consultations with
the public and various interest groups ran from 20 June to 28 November 2022.
The Commission presented its finalised report to the President on 10 February
2023.[32]

## Election date and timeline

[edit]

Unless a snap election is called, a general election is held every five years.
The previous election was held on 23 October 2019. The president must issue
writs for an election within sixty days of the expiration or dissolution of
parliament. Under section 91 (3) of the constitution, parliament, "…unless
sooner dissolved, shall continue for five years from the date of the first
sitting of the National Assembly after any dissolution and shall then stand
dissolved".[33] If left to dissolve on its own, parliament would have done so
on 5 November 2024. As a result, the latest possible date to hold the next
election within constitutional limits would be on 4 January 2025.

However, due to longstanding convention, general elections are held in October
and parliament is usually dissolved during the last week of August and rarely
in the first week of September.[34][35] Thus, on the 3rd of September 2024,
President Mokgweetsi Masisi announced that the writs for the 2024 election
will be returned on 5 September 2024 and parliament will stand dissolved on
the same day;[36] as a result, the election to the 13th Parliament must have
been held no later than 4 November 2024.

It was widely accepted by political commentators, news media and the
Independent Electoral Commission that the next election would be held in
October 2024. Indeed, in his announcement the president stated that Wednesday,
30 October 2024, will be the election date and that the day and the next will
be public holidays in an effort to boost turnout. The 13th Parliament shall
commence within 30 days of the date of the general election. The schedule for
the election is as follows:[36][37]

## Voter registration

[edit]

Botswana uses a 'periodic list' voter registration system where the election
authority creates a new list of eligible voters every five years before each
election, as opposed to a continuous register or civil registry. This process
occurs just before the election and involves aiming to register all voters
within a relatively short time frame. It is 'self-initiated' in the sense that
voters must go to the electoral authority's centres nationwide to register
themselves rather than the election authority going to the people.[38]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Botswana_voter_registration_poster.jpg/220px-
Botswana_voter_registration_poster.jpg)Voter registration poster at a polling
station in Gaborone Central constituency.

The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) oversaw the general voter
registration, which began on 5 January, 2024 and ended on 3 February.
Approximately 2,800 polling stations were open daily from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on
weekdays and 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekends. All citizens aged 18 years and
above were eligible to register to vote.[39] The total number of people who
registered during the general registration was 764,539. Following a lower-
than-expected number of registered electors after the general registration,
two supplementary voter registration periods were held. The first, from 26
February to 15 March, added an additional 74,404 registered electors. The
second and final supplementary registration took place from 20 to 31 May and
was conducted across approximately 2,808 nationwide polling stations, unlike
the first, which was held at harder-to-reach district commissioners' offices
and Kgotlas. This phase yielded an additional 197,021 registered
electors.[40][41]

### Observation controversy

[edit]

In the lead-up to the general voter registration, the UDC established the
_Madibelatlhopho_ (lit. 'Protectors of the vote'), a group of UDC supporters
constituted ad hoc to oversee the voter registration process. Their aim was to
prevent alleged rigging in favour of the BDP by the IEC. The voter
registration period for the 2024 general elections in Botswana was initially
scheduled to run from 1 to 30 November 2023. However, it was indefinitely
postponed due to legal challenges from the UDC.[42][43]

On 7 November, Justice Gaolapelwe Ketlogetswe of the Francistown High Court
issued a rule nisi requiring the IEC and other parties to justify why the
UDC's _Madibelatlhopho_ should be restrained from monitoring the national
registration process. This decision temporarily allowed UDC observers to
proceed with their plan to observe the registration cycle until the court's
final determination. The court order permitted UDC clerks to daily record the
names, national identity card numbers and registration booklets' serial
numbers of registrants. The IEC announced a further postponement of the
registration period, shifting it to occur from 13 November to 8 December 2023,
to prevent UDC observers from accessing polling stations until the Court of
Appeal, the country's highest court, made its final ruling.[44]

The apex court ruled in favour of the IEC, denying the UDC's request to have
the _Madibelatlhopho_ access to registration booklets and other confidential
voter information. This decision overturned the previous Francistown High
Court ruling that had allowed the UDC to monitor the voter registration
process. However, the court found no legal basis in the Electoral Act to grant
the UDC such monitoring rights. The Leader of the Opposition, Dithapelo
Keorapetse, expressed disappointment with the judgment, viewing it as "a
setback for democracy".[45]

In accordance with Section 7 of the Presidential Elections law, the Secretary
of the Independent Election Commission appointed authenticating officers
tasked with verifying the authenticity of documents submitted by presidential
aspirants for the indirect presidential elections that occur as a form of an
investiture vote after the general election of MPs. These officers were
district commissioners, district officers and senior police officers. Acting
as the returning officer for the presidential nomination process, the Chief
Justice of the High Court received the nomination papers of the candidates on
28 September 2024, during two time slots: from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 2:30
to 5:00 p.m.[47] The venue for this process was at the High Court headquarters
in Gaborone. At the conclusion of this procedure, three political party
leaders were duly declared as validly nominated candidates for the office of
President, as shown below.

The BDP pledged to diversify the economy through developing the mineral
resources processing, agriculture and tourism sectors. The UDC pledged to
increase the monthly minimum wage from 1,500 pula ($112) to 4,000 pula
($300).[53]

## Results

[edit]

The election resulted in a historic defeat for the ruling Botswana Democratic
Party (BDP), which lost the uninterrupted majority it had held since
independence following the 1966 general election. Significant swings toward
the Umbrella for Democratic Change in the southern and central regions,
alongside losses to the Botswana Congress Party in the north, reduced the BDP
to the smallest party in the National Assembly.[54]

The table below presents the proportionality of parliamentary seats won in the
2024 election, as measured by the Gallagher index. This election yielded an
index score of **23.05** , indicating a highly disproportionate outcome that
strongly favoured the UDC and BCP while being significantly disadvantageous
for the BDP. This is the most disproportionate result ever recorded in a
Botswana National Assembly election.[55]

## Aftermath

[edit]

BDP leader and President Mokgweetsi Masisi conceded defeat to the UDC and Duma
Boko on 1 November 2024.[56][57] Boko praised the election result as an
example of democracy in action, adding that "What has happened today takes our
democracy to a higher level".[58] Boko was inaugurated as president on 1
November.[59]

## Notes

[edit]

  1. **^** Per the Independent Electoral Commission of Botswana.[1]
  2. **^** Eight of the seats in the 69-member legislature are not directly elected by the voters. Out of these eight seats, six are 'specially-elected' members appointed by the president and approved by the National Assembly. The remaining two seats are occupied by the Speaker and the President as ex _-officio_ members.
  3. **^** Following the prohibition of floor crossings in 2021, the UDC officially had 14 MPs at the dissolution of parliament. Seven of these were BCP MPs who had left the UDC alliance ahead of the 2024 election.[2] The seat figure presented here reflects the actual number of UDC MPs at the time of dissolution, including Yandani Boko (former MP for Mahalapye East), whose vacant seat did not trigger a by-election.
  4. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ As part of the UDC alliance, the BCP won 11 seats and its candidates who stood under the UDC received approximately 14.57% of the national popular vote.
  5. **^** Incumbent presidents are ineligible to contest National Assembly seats; instead, they serve as _ex-officio_ members of Parliament.
  6. **^** Dumezweni Mthimkhulu, former MP for Gaborone South, died three days before the dissolution of parliament, so a by-election for the seat was never held.[3] The seat figure presented here includes Mthimkhulu.

  1. **^** "UDC" only–29.4%  
BNF–5.1%  
AP–2.9%  
BPP–0.1%

  2. **^** RAP (disbanded in March 2023)–0.1%  
All others–0.8%

  3. **^** Would not vote–14.6%  
Refused to answer–7.4%  
Don't know–5.8%
