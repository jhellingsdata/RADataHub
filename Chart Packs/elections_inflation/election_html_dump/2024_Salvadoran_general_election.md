General elections were held in El Salvador in February and March 2024. In the
first round on 4 February, voters elected the president, vice president, and
all 60 deputies of the Legislative Assembly. In the second round on 3 March,
voters elected mayors and municipal councils[b] for all 44 of the country's
municipalities and all 20 of El Salvador's deputies to the Central American
Parliament (PARLACEN).[c]

The Supreme Electoral Court (TSE) allowed 13 political parties to participate
in the election. Seven parties ran presidential candidates; incumbent
president Nayib Bukele ran for re-election with Nuevas Ideas,[d] the political
party he established in 2018, while the political opposition's presidential
candidates were: Joel Sánchez of the Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA),
Manuel Flores of the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN), Luis
Parada of Nuestro Tiempo, Javier Renderos of Solidary Force, Marina Murillo of
the Salvadoran Patriotic Fraternity (FPS). Ten parties participated in the
legislative elections, eleven in the municipal elections, and nine in the
PARLACEN election. Opinion polling indicated significant leads for Nuevas
Ideas in the presidential, legislative, and municipal elections, as well as
high support for Bukele's re-election.

In September 2021, the Supreme Court of Justice ruled that the incumbent
president could run for immediate re-election despite the country's
constitution prohibiting immediate re-election, overturning a 2014 ruling that
reaffirmed that re-election was prohibited. In September 2022, Bukele
officially announced that he was running for re-election. In June 2023, he
officially registered as a presidential candidate for Nuevas Ideas, and the
following month, Nuevas Ideas formally confirmed Bukele as its presidential
candidate. Various lawyers, journalists, and opposition politicians criticized
Bukele's re-election bid as authoritarian and unconstitutional, while most
Salvadorans—both inside and outside the country—remained highly supportive of
his campaign. In October 2022, the Legislative Assembly passed a law that
allowed Salvadoran expatriates to vote in the election. Several opposition
politicians criticized the decision, claiming that it would lead to electoral
fraud. In December 2022, Bukele suggested reducing the number of
municipalities and, in June 2023, he officially presented his proposals to
reduce the number of municipalities from 262 to 44 and the number of seats in
the Legislative Assembly from 84 to 60 to the Legislative Assembly. The
Legislative Assembly approved both proposals that same month. The reductions
were criticized by lawyers, economists, and opposition politicians as
gerrymandering, undemocratic, and an attempt to consolidate the government's
power.

On election day, Bukele declared himself the winner in the presidential
election and declared Nuevas Ideas the winner in the legislative election.
Various foreign media outlets called the election for Bukele. These
declarations came before the TSE made an official statement regarding the
final results because vote counting for both the presidential and legislative
elections was delayed due to technical problems. On 9 February 2024, the TSE
finished counting votes for the presidential election and officially declared
Bukele the winner, having accumulated 84.65 percent of the popular vote in a
landslide victory. On 18 February, the TSE finished counting votes for the
legislative election; Nuevas Ideas won 54 of the Legislative Assembly's 60
seats. The political opposition submitted two petitions the TSE to nullify the
results of the legislative election, citing irregularities and allegations of
fraud, but the TSE dismissed both petitions. Nuevas Ideas won 28
municipalities, its allies won an additional 15 municipalities, and the
opposition won 1 municipality. The elected deputies, mayors, and municipal
councils assumed office on 1 May, while Bukele and Ulloa assumed office on 1
June.

## Political background

[edit]

### Presidency of Nayib Bukele

Discurso_de_Bukele_en_2019.jpg)Nayib Bukele speaking on 1 June 2019, the day
of his inauguration

Nayib Bukele, the former mayor of San Salvador, won the 2019 Salvadoran
presidential election with 53 percent of the vote. He ran under the banner of
the Grand Alliance for National Unity (GANA), making him the first president
since José Napoleón Duarte (1984–1989) to not be a member of one of the
country's two largest political parties: the Nationalist Republican Alliance
(ARENA) and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN).[8][9]
Bukele's election is considered one of the most impactful events in Salvadoran
political history, with many politicians and journalists described it as
breaking the country's two-party system.[10]

Throughout his presidency, Bukele's government was described as authoritarian
and autocratic,[11] resulting in what many journalists described as democratic
backsliding.[12] His COVID-19 lockdowns were criticized when the National
Civil Police arrested more than 4,200 people.[13] In February 2020, he was
criticized for sending 40 soldiers into the Legislative Assembly to pressure
lawmakers to approve a US$109 million loan to fund the Territorial Control
Plan, a security program initiated by Bukele, in what critics described as an
attempted coup d'état.[14] In September 2020, _El Faro_ accused Bukele of
negotiating with criminal gangs in the country, notably Mara Salvatrucha
(MS-13) and the 18th Street gang, to lower crime rates. Bukele and his
government denied those accusations.[15][16] The United States government
labeled various Bukele government officials as corrupt.[17] In the 2021
legislative election, Nuevas Ideas, the political party Bukele established,
won supermajorities[18][19] in the Legislative Assembly, municipalities, and
the Central American Parliament (PARLACEN).[20][21][22] The 13th session of
the Legislative Assembly assumed office on 1 May 2021, and Ernesto Castro was
elected as the president of the Legislative Assembly.[23] Following Castro's
election, the 64 legislators representing Nuevas Ideas, GANA, the Christian
Democratic Party (PDC), and the National Coalition Party (PCN) voted to remove
Attorney General Raúl Melara and five Supreme Court justices from the
constitutional court. Bukele later appointed a new attorney general and new
justices in what has since been described as a self-coup.[24]

Following a spike in murders in March 2022, Bukele's government began a gang
crackdown, referred to as a state of exception and a war against gangs, which
resulted in the reported arrests of over 75,163 alleged gang members by 11
January 2024[25] and 144 to 152 deaths in custody by 10 May 2023.[26] The
crackdown, which had since been extended several times, has been accused of
engaging in arbitrary arrests, torture, and human rights abuses by
organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.[27][28] On
3 January 2023, Minister of Defense René Merino Monroy announced that 496
homicides were recorded in 2022, a decrease from 1,147 homicides in 2021;
Merino attributed the decrease to the gang crackdown.[29] Politicians from
ARENA, the FMLN, and Nuestro Tiempo described the crackdown as a political and
electoral strategy to support the government and intimidate the
opposition.[30]

Despite controversies and negative press coverage, Bukele remains extremely
popular with approval ratings consistently hovering between 80 and 90
percent.[10][31][32] He is considered to be one of the most popular presidents
in El Salvador's history,[33] as well as one of the most popular incumbent
Latin American heads of state.[34][35]

### Presidential re-election controversy

[edit]

See also: Continuismo

On 3 September 2021, the Supreme Court of Justice ruled that the president of
El Salvador is eligible to run for re-election in consecutive terms,
discarding a 2014 ruling that required presidents to wait ten years before
running for re-election. The 2021 court ruling made Bukele eligible to run for
president in 2024.[36] Despite protests from ARENA and the FMLN, the Supreme
Electoral Court (TSE) accepted the Supreme Court's ruling.[37] Chargé
d'Affaires Jean Elizabeth Manes compared the path the Salvadoran government
was taking to that of Venezuela under Hugo Chávez.[38] On 1 March 2023, four
of the five members of the Supreme Court's Constitutional Chamber confirmed
that presidential re-election is allowed.[39]

> "Practically all developed countries have re-election ... prohibitions on
> re-election only exist in the Third World, coincidentally." ("_Prácticamente
> todos los países desarrollados tienen reelección ... las prohibiciones de
> reelección solo existen en el tercer mundo, coincidentalmente._ ")

independence, where he announced he is running for re-election in 2024 (at
34:00)  
  
During a speech on the country's 201st anniversary of independence from Spain
on 15 September 2022, Bukele officially announced his re-election campaign[41]
despite having previously voiced his opposition to immediate re-election both
before and during his presidency.[42] Bukele justified his re-election bid by
arguing that most developed countries allow re-election; he read a list of 39
countries the International Monetary Fund (IMF) considers "developed," and
stated that all the countries on the list, except for South Korea, allowed re-
election.[43] He also claimed that restrictions on re-election only exists in
third-world countries.[44] According to Bukele, a developed country
criticizing his announcement would be hypocritical.[43] On 25 June 2023,
Bukele officially registered his pre-candidacy for the presidency with Nuevas
Ideas,[45] and on 9 July, Nuevas Ideas officially elected Bukele as its
presidential candidate.[46]

Bukele would have been be the first person since Brigadier General Maximiliano
Hernández Martínez (in office 1931–1934 and 1935–1944) to be re-elected and
serve multiple terms as president.[47][48] Additionally, he was the first
president since Antonio Saca (served 2004–2009) to seek re-election.[e][50]
Bukele has been compared to Juan Orlando Hernández in Honduras and Daniel
Ortega in Nicaragua, who used the Supreme Court and constitutional reforms,
respectively, in their own countries to allow themselves to run for re-
election.[51][52][53] According to a poll conducted by the Francisco Gavidia
University (UFG) in October 2022, 76 percent of respondents believed that if
Bukele were re-elected in 2024, he would run for a third term in the 2029
presidential election.[54]

#### Criticism and opposition to re-election

election_%28June_2023%29.jpg)Supporters of Bukele's re-election in front of
the Legislative Assembly

Bukele's announcement that he was running for re-election was criticized by
constitutional lawyers, who said his re-election would be unconstitutional and
violate at least four articles of El Salvador's constitution.[55][56]
Following Bukele's registration as a presidential pre-candidate, Eduardo
Escobar, the executive director of the Citizen Action non-governmental
organization, stated that "everything is unconstitutional and they are only
trying to give a face of legitimacy to everything with these gimmicks" ("_todo
es inconstitucional y solo están tratando de darle una cara de legitimidad a
todo con estos artilugios_ ").[57] Manuel Flores, then the FMLN's presidential
pre-candidate, stated that "the law is the law [and] the law says that there
is no re-election" ("_la ley es la ley [y] la ley dice que no hay reelección_
"), adding that the constitution is "clear" ("_clara_ ") in prohibiting re-
election.[51] Citizen Resistance politician Rubén Zamora stated that the
Legislative Assembly had to suspend Bukele's rights as a Salvadoran citizen in
accordance with the constitution for registering as a pre-candidate for
presidential re-election.[58] Both Zamora and Claudia Ortiz, a deputy from
Vamos, argued that articles 75, 88, 131, 152, 154, and 248 of the country's
constitution prohibit immediate re-election.[59]

On 1 May 2023, 36 left-wing organizations—including the FMLN and Nuestro
Tiempo—held a protest march on International Workers' Day against Bukele's re-
election campaign and the gang crackdown.[60] The protesters also demanded an
increase of minimum wage from US$365 to US$500, respect for workers' rights,
and the release of innocent people captured during the gang crackdown.[61][62]
On 15 September, various organizations and civil movements held another
protest march against re-election. The march traveled from the Rosales
Hospital to the Plaza Gerardo Barrios.[63] According to Francisco Omar Parada,
a spokesman for the Resistance and Popular Rebellion Bloc, the march protested
presidential re-election, the reductions of municipalities and seats on the
Legislative Assembly, the "destruction" ("_destrucción_ ") of democratic
institutions, and the "illegal control" ("_control ilegal_ ") exerted by the
presidency, the judiciary, the Office of the Attorney General, and other state
institutions.[64] The presidential candidates for ARENA, the FMLN, and Nuestro
Tiempo participated in the protest, as did various opposition deputies of the
Legislative Assembly.[63]

In October and November 2023, a total of ten formal requests were submitted to
the TSE calling for the body to not register Bukele's presidential candidacy
or void his candidacy after he initiated the registration process. Nuestro
Tiempo, ARENA, and various NGOs filed these requests.[65] On 9 November, the
TSE reaffirmed that Bukele's candidacy was legal and dismissed all the
petitions to void his candidacy.[66]

Vice President Félix Ulloa, who supports Bukele's re-election bid, had
suggested that Bukele should seek a leave of absence or express permission
from the Supreme Court six months before the election.[67] In April 2023,
Ulloa stated that Bukele was seeking a "second mandate" ("_segundo mandato_ ")
rather than re-election, adding that, while immediate re-election was
prohibited by the constitution, a second mandate was not.[68] Some
politicians, including Ulloa, also suggested that Bukele should resign six
months before the election to be able to legally pursue re-election, but
according to constitutional lawyer Enrique Anaya, resigning would have
annulled Bukele's legal immunity and allow him to be prosecuted for alleged
corruption and human rights violations.[69] Other constitutional lawyers state
that his re-election campaign would be unconstitutional regardless.[70] Ulloa
and Nuevas Ideas' deputy Christian Guevara stated that both Bukele and Ulloa
would resign before 1 December 2023, six months before their second
inauguration if they win re-election, and that a successor would be designated
as president.[71] On 28 November, Bukele announced he would ask for a leave of
absence from the Legislative Assembly on 1 December to relieve him of his
duties as president to focus on his presidential election campaign.[72] Bukele
was granted a leave of absence on 30 November and Claudia Rodríguez de
Guevara, his private secretary, was named as presidential designee;[73] she
assumed office the following day and her appointment was criticized as
unconstitutional by analysts and lawyers.[74][75][76]

### Allegations of fraud

[edit]

On 18 January 2023, the Legislative Assembly passed a resolution to increase
the criminal penalty for electoral fraud to 15–20 years in prison from the
previous penalty of 4–6 years. If the individual was a gang member, the
penalty was increased further to 20–30 years of imprisonment.[77] On 16
February, the Legislative Assembly passed a law making it illegal to impede
the registration process for electoral candidates. According to the updated
penal code, impeding a candidate's registration process is legally considered
electoral fraud and would result in 6–20 years of imprisonment.[78] Lawyers
and electoral experts alleged that the updated law would be used against those
who opposed Bukele's re-election campaign; Eduardo Escobar and Ruth Eleonora
López, the chief of Cristosal's anti-corruption committee, claimed that it was
intimidation and a threat.[79]

In addition to the Unique Identity Document [es] (DUI; the primary identity
document for Salvadorans), TSE magistrates Julio Olivo [es] and Dora Martínez
de Barahona suggested using biometrics, specifically fingerprinting, to ensure
election security.[80][81] The Office for the Defense of Human Rights, a
Salvadoran governmental agency, was an observer for the 2024 elections.[82] In
March 2023, Votante, a voter's initiative created by five Salvadoran civil
society organizations, petitioned the TSE to allow the United Nations, the
Organization of American States (OAS), and the European Union (EU) to monitor
the elections.[83] On 26 March, the TSE began the process of accepting
international observers to monitor the election,[84] anticipating that almost
5,800 national and international observers to monitor the election. In
September 2023, the TSE officially accepted the OAS and the EU as election
monitors for the 2024 election process;[85] the OAS accepted the TSE's offer
while the EU stated that it would support the electoral process.[86] Isabel
Saint Malo, a former vice president of Panama, was the head of the OAS
election observation mission.[87] In October 2023, the TSE announced that it
had signed an agreement with Mexico's Monterrey Institute of Technology and
Higher Education to audit the expatriate electronic voting process[88] and
another agreement with CGTS Corp. to audit both the expatriate electronic
voting process and the expatriate electoral registry.[89]

On 18 October 2022, the Legislative Assembly passed the Special Law for the
Exercise of Suffrage Abroad, which allowed Salvadorans living outside of the
country to vote electronically in the presidential and legislative elections,
but not the municipal or PARLACEN elections.[90][91] The TSE announced on 17
November 2022 that it would guarantee the right of Salvadorans abroad to vote
in the 2024 election.[92][93] According to the TSE, a total of 685,026
Salvadoran expatriates in 53 countries were eligible to vote as of 19 August
2023[update].[94] Under the electoral law, their votes would be counted as
part of San Salvador Department.[95] Some opposition figures claimed that the
law would lead to voter fraud,[96][97][98] while Castro rejected the notion
that fraud would occur in the expatriate voting process.[99]

Per the Law of Political Parties, the TSE did not monitor the political
parties' primary elections for irregularities.[100] In June 2023, some members
of Nuevas Ideas claimed that there were irregularities present in the party's
primary elections. They criticized the party for presenting single-candidate
primaries and promoting Bukele's family members for municipal races.[101] On 1
July, Nuevas Ideas' National Electoral Commission announced that it would open
an internal investigation to guarantee that the party's statutes and
regulations were followed and that those who attempted to manipulate the
electoral process would be punished and turned over to the country's legal
system.[102] On 31 July, Nuevas Ideas suspended Rebeca Santos's legislative
candidacy after videos surfaced allegedly showing Santos's staffers soliciting
party members for codes to vote in her favor.[103] On 30 June 2023, Mayra
Zetino, the mayor of Sacacoyo and a member of GANA, announced her departure
from GANA, claiming that there was a lack of transparency and low confidence
in the party's primary election process.[104] Guillermo Gallegos, the vice
president of GANA and a deputy of the Legislative Assembly, responded to
Zetino's announcement by stating that there were no irregularities within the
party.[105]

According to a UFG opinion poll conducted in May and June 2023, 62.8 percent
of Salvadorans believed the elections would be "clean and transparent"
("_limpias y transparentes_ "), 25 percent had doubts about the election's
legitimacy, and 9.7 percent believed there would be fraud.[106] A poll
conducted by the Central American University in November 2023 found that 45.2
percent of Salvadorans believed that the elections would be "clean"
("_limpias_ "), while 31.5 percent believed there would be fraud.[107]

### Reduction of municipalities and legislative seats

[edit]

#### Initial proposals, support, and criticism

reductions

On 30 December 2022, Bukele tweeted that he believed the country's 262
municipalities should be reduced to only 50, claiming that it was "absurd that
21,000 km2 are divided into 262 municipalities" ("_absurdo que 21,000 kms 2
estén divididos en 262 alcaldías_").[f][108] Various economists, lawyers, and
politicians argued that the proposed reduction was an attempt to consolidate
power through gerrymandering,[109] would grant Nuevas Ideas an electoral
advantage,[110] and would lead to data manipulation to favor the
government.[111] Eugenio Chicas, a former TSE magistrate TSE, denounced the
idea, claiming that it was a part of Bukele's "political vision" to
consolidate a military dictatorship.[112]

Gallegos expressed his support for Bukele's proposal, adding that he believed
the number of seats in the Legislative Assembly should also be reduced.[113]
Ulloa supported reducing the number of seats in the Legislative Assembly and
suggested decreasing it from 84 to 50 seats.[114] In February 2023, Castro
confirmed that Nuevas Ideas was considering reducing the number of deputies in
the Legislative Assembly from 84 to 64 and the number of municipalities from
252 to 50.[115]

John Wright, a Nuestro Tiempo deputy, described the proposal to reduce the
number of deputies as "extremely irresponsible" for occurring within one year
of the election.[116] Claudia Ortiz criticized the announcement, stating the
proposed reforms could help Nuevas Ideas form a one-party state. She also
argued that the time to make electoral reforms had passed and that the changes
would violate Article 291-A of the electoral code,[115] which prohibits
electoral reforms up to one year before an election.[117] On 15 March 2023,
the Legislative Assembly voted to repeal Article 291-A,[118] which ARENA
deputy René Portillo Cuadra described as unconstitutional.[119] and the
Washington Office on Latin America, a U.S. non-governmental organization,
described as "the latest backstep in the country".[120]

In February 2023, GANA deputy Newman Salgado claimed that the country's
population would support the reductions of Assembly deputies and
municipalities.[115] According to a poll conducted by the Francisco Gavidia
University that month, around 48.5 percent of Salvadorans erroneously believed
that El Salvador was already divided into only 50 municipalities.[121]
According to a Fundaungo poll in March 2023, 48.8 percent of Salvadorans
supported reducing the number of municipalities, while 44.2 opposed it.
Meanwhile, 80.2 percent supported reducing the number of legislative seats,
while only 16.4 opposed it.[122] A May 2023 poll conducted by UFG found that
66.4 percent supported the reduction of municipalities while 39.4 percent
opposed it.[123] A later Fundaungo poll in September 2023 found that 66.9
percent of Salvadorans supported the reduction of municipalities while 27.4
percent opposed it.[124]

#### Legislative Assembly approval

[edit]

Nayib_Bukele_with_a_legislative_proposal_%281_June_2023%29.jpg)Bukele
proposing the reduction of municipalities on 1 June 2023

During a speech celebrating his fourth year in office on 1 June 2023, Bukele
formally proposed legislation to reduce the number of municipalities from 262
to 44 and the number of seats in the Legislative Assembly from 84 to 60.[125]
Regarding the municipal reduction, he stated that the present municipalities
would be transformed into districts, adding that municipal employees would
keep their jobs and that communities would still be able to celebrate their
local traditions and customs. Bukele argued that the reduction would also
reduce the budgetary burden on the municipalities, make a "more equitable"
distribution of taxation possible, and make electing and auditing mayors
easier.[126][127] Regarding the legislative reduction, he stated that the
number of seats would return to the number that were present before the 1992
Chapultepec Peace Accords. He criticized opposition politicians, stating "this
Assembly once had 60 deputies, it did not occur to us this government that
those in the corner do not like this announcement because ARENA and the FMLN,
in that farce they signed, added 24 more deputies and it was the only thing
that they accomplished in those 'peace accords'" ("_esta Asamblea tenía 60
diputados, no se nos ocurrió en este Gobierno, a esos de la esquina no les
gusta este anuncio porque ARENA y el FMLN en esa farsa que firmaron añadieron
a 24 diputados más y fue lo único que cumplieron en esos 'acuerdos de paz'_
").[128]

ARENA stated that the reductions were a "tactic to swing the electoral field
in [Nuevas Ideas'] favor" ("_táctica para inclinar la cancha electoral a su
favor_ ").[131] Claudia Ortiz stated that the reduction of municipalities was
to benefit Nuevas Ideas' mayors who had done a "very bad job" since their
election in 2021. Marleni Funes, an FMLN deputy, claimed that Bukele wanted to
guarantee his grip on power and that every Salvadoran knows that fewer
resources would arrive when the municipalities were reduced.[132] Óscar Ortiz,
the secretary-general of the FMLN, described the proposals as "institutional
fraud" for occurring during the lead up to the 2024 election.[133]

On 7 June 2023, the Legislative Assembly approved the proposal to reduce the
Legislative Assembly from 84 to 60 seats. Anabel Belloso, an FMLN deputy,
claimed that the purpose of the legislative reduction was to "continue
concentrating power", and other opposition figures argued that the reduction
would diminish the smaller parties' political participation.[134][135] In
contrast, GANA deputy Romeo Aüerbach denied that the reductions would affect
the representation of smaller parties. Claudia Ortiz and ARENA deputy César
Reyes claimed that the reduction would assure and concentrate more power for
Nuevas Ideas.[136]

On 13 June 2023, the Legislative Assembly approved the proposal to reduce the
number of municipalities from 262 to 44, with the proposal stipulating that
the reductions would go into effect on 1 May 2024.[130] López described the
process of reducing municipalities as having been conducted in an "arbitrary
and whimsical" manner, and argued that the reductions would distance the
municipal governments from the people they govern.[137] Portillo Cuadra
described the reductions as "counterproductive" as it would assign mayors to
oversee more people in each municipality. Wright claimed that the reductions
would concentrate power among fewer people and that municipal representation
was becoming "less democratic".[138] He claimed that the municipal reductions
were electoral objectives rather than a desire to promote development or save
money and questioned the lack of studies conducted to determine if the 262
municipalities should be reduced to 44. In response to the opposition's
criticism, Castro claimed that the political opposition was becoming desperate
because the country was returning to a "fair system".[139]

## Electoral system

[edit]

### Election procedure

[edit]

General elections were scheduled to be held in El Salvador five years after
the 2019 presidential election and three years after the 2021 legislative
election.[18][140] The president, vice president, 60 Legislative Assembly
deputies, 44 mayors and municipal councils of the country's municipalities
(second-level subdivisions), and 20 Central American Parliament deputies were
elected through a popular vote. El Salvador's constitution mandated that the
election would be "free, direct, equal and secret".[141] On 11 August 2022,
the Supreme Electoral Court announced that the elections for the presidency,
vice presidency, and the Legislative Assembly would be held on Sunday, 4
February 2024, and that the elections for the 44 municipalities and the
Central American Parliament would be held on Sunday, 3 March 2024. If a second
presidential round had been necessary, it would have occurred on 3 March.[142]
Voting was held from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Central Standard Time.[143]

To win the presidential election, a candidate needs an absolute majority (50%
+ 1). If no candidate received an absolute majority, a second round between
the two candidates with the most valid votes would have occurred within 30
days of the first round.[141][144] Deputies of the Legislative Assembly were
elected by the D'Hondt method, which was changed in June 2023 from the hare
quota largest remainders method used in previous elections.[145] Meanwhile,
mayors, municipal council members, and Central American Parliament deputies
were elected by open list proportional representation. The 60 deputies of the
Legislative Assembly were elected in 14 constituencies for the country's 14
departments (first-level subdivisions), the 44 mayors and municipal councils
were elected for each constituency, and the 20 Central American Parliament
deputies were elected from one nationwide constituency.[141][144]

of the presidential election ballot

Presidential and vice presidential candidates must be at least 30 years old,
legislative candidates must be at least 25 years old, and municipal candidates
must be at least 21 years old. All candidates must be Salvadoran citizens by
birth.[146] Per article 38 of the Law of Political Parties, at least 30
percent of a party's total candidates for the legislative, municipal, and
PARLACEN elections must be women.[147] In addition to the 60 deputies elected
to the Legislative Assembly and the 20 deputies elected to PARLACEN (referred
to as proprietary deputies), an additional 60 substitute deputies were elected
to the Legislative Assembly and 20 substitute deputies were elected to
PARLACEN. Voters in each of the 44 municipalities elected 1 mayor and a
varying number of members to the municipal council. Each municipal council
consisted of 1 trustee, 4 proprietary aldermen, and 4 substitute alderman,
however, two municipalities elected 8 proprietary alderman and two more
elected 10 proprietary alderman due to those municipalities' larger size. In
total, 624 people were elected to hold public office in the 2024 elections, a
decrease from 3,206 in 2021.[2][148]

A total of 1,595 voting centers were available across the country.[149] Voting
was not compulsory.[150] Electronic voting for Salvadoran expatriates began at
midnight on 6 January 2024.[151] Expatriates were able to vote at 81 voting
centers in 60 of the country's embassies and consulates[152] in 30 countries;
42 eligible voters in 22 countries were unable to vote.[153] The designs for
all four ballots—presidential, legislative, municipal, and PARLACEN—were
finalized on 6 December 2023.[154]

### Election financing

[edit]

![A website banner displaying the TSE's logo and the text "2024 Elections" in

TSE's 2024 election website banner

In December 2022, TSE magistrate Noel Orellana estimated that it would cost
between US$25 and 30 million to finance the expatriate vote for the 2024
election,[155] but later revised the estimate to US$120 million.[156] In
February 2023, the TSE announced that the expatriate vote would cost US$70.6
million and the national election would cost US$89 million, for a total cost
of US$159.7 million for the 2024 election.[157] In March 2023, the TSE reduced
its estimate to US$129.3 million and formally requested that amount from the
Legislative Assembly.[158] The Legislative Assembly approved the TSE's request
on 15 March 2023,[159] making the 2024 election the most expensive election in
Salvadoran history.[160]

On 10 June 2023, the TSE announced that it came to an agreement with El
Salvador Products and Services Exchange (BOLPROS) regarding procurement
procedures for the election.[161] On 20 June, the TSE announced that it had
signed an agreement with the National Charity Lottery (LNB) regarding the
verification of financial information of political parties. Through the
agreement, the TSE was able to compare the financial information the political
parties presented, with the LNB handling the data.[162] On 29 June, the TSE
announced that it had contracted Indra Solutions to implement electronic
voting.[163]

### Political parties

[edit]

Political parties must be registered with the TSE to be able to participate in
elections. The following table shows the thirteen political parties that were
eligible to participate in the 2024 election.

Party[164] | Leader[164] | 2021 results

 _Fuerza Solidaria_ | Rigoberto Soto  | New party   
  
Additionally, various civil movements attempted to register with the TSE to
gain political party status and to run in the 2024 election. Such civil
movements included Citizen Power, the Authentic Republican Movement, the
Authentic Salvadoran Movement (MAS), We Shall Construct a New El Salvador, the
Salvadoran Veteran Party, Somos, and i.[165][166][167][168] Citizen Power
announced its primary elections in March 2023, but the TSE declared the
announcement invalid because they were not registered to participate in the
2024 election.[169] In mid-April 2023, the party turned in 50,000 signatures
to the TSE to be registered as a political party.[170] MAS abandoned its
efforts to register in early-April 2023.[171] In late-2022, Paul Monroy, the
leader of i, announced the movement abandoned its efforts to register with the
TSE.[172]

### Registered voters

[edit]

Salvadoran citizens over the age of 18 living in El Salvador had until 7
August 2023 to register to vote,[173] while those living outside of the
country had until 5 November 2023 to register.[174] Salvadorans in the country
had until 3 April 2023 to change their address of residency on their Unique
Identity Document, while those living abroad had until 5 November 2023.[175]
Guillermo Wellman, a magistrate of the TSE, stated that individuals arrested
during the country's gang crackdown were ineligible to vote.[176] In the
legislative election, votes cast from outside of the country were counted
towards selecting deputies in the department of San Salvador.[177] There were
a total of 6,214,399 registered voters.[178]

## Presidency

## Parliament

[edit]

Nuevas Ideas held a majority in the 13th Legislative Assembly; GANA, the PDC,
and the PCN supported Nuevas Ideas' government. The opposition consisted of
ARENA, the FMLN, Nuestro Tiempo, and Vamos.[192] Within the Central American
Parliament, the fifteen deputies from Nuevas Ideas and GANA belong to the
Center-Democratic Integration Group, the four deputies from ARENA and the PCN
belong to the Integrationist Democratic Unity, and the sole FMLN deputy
belongs to the Parliamentary Group of the Left.[193]

In the years following the 2021 legislative election, three deputies and
twenty-two mayors from ARENA left the party and become independents, as had
eleven mayors from the FMLN, and one deputy and two mayors from GANA.[194]

### Retiring deputies

[edit]

Eighteen deputies elected to the Legislative Assembly in 2021 did not run for
re-election in 2024 because they chose to run for another office, were
eliminated during their party's primary elections, were suspended by their
party prior to the election, or they chose not to seek public office in 2024.

## Electoral campaign

[edit]

The TSE mandated that the parties had to announce their primary elections by 5
March 2023.[202] The TSE initially required that the parties hold their
primary elections by 5 July 2023,[203] but after the Legislative Assembly
voted to reduce the number of municipalities in June 2023, the TSE delayed the
deadline for primary elections until 20 July 2023.[204] Political parties had
until 7 August 2023 to register presidential and legislative coalitions.
Parties had until 4 September 2023 to form municipal and PARLACEN
coalitions.[205] In total, there were 7 presidential candidates, 7 vice
presidential candidates, 313 legislative candidates, 202 municipal candidates,
and 80 PARLACEN candidates.[206] According to Citizen Action, only 67,415—or
26.4 percent—of registered political party members voted in the country's
primary elections, the lowest percentage since the organization had been
keeping track of this statistic since the 2015 primary elections.[207]

The TSE regulated campaigning on Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, and
Instagram,[208] but it did not regulate campaigning outside of the
country.[209] The following table lists the electoral registration and
campaigning periods as defined by the TSE.

Election type  | Registration period[210] | Campaign period[211] | Election date[142]  
---|---|---|---  
President and Vice President  | 7 September 2023 – 26 October 2023  | 3 October 2023 – 31 January 2024  | 4 February 2024   
Legislative Assembly deputies  | 3 December 2023 – 31 January 2024   
PARLACEN deputies  | 7 September 2023 – 23 November 2023  | 2 January 2023 – 28 February 2024  | 3 March 2024   
Municipal mayors and councils  | 16 October 2023 – 23 November 2023  | 5 February 2024 – 28 February 2024   
  
Before the campaign period began, some Nuevas Ideas politicians began to
promote their electoral campaigns on Twitter and others purchased online
advertising through Google Ads. López criticized the campaigns as illegal,
arguing they violated article 172 of the electoral code.[212] Legal experts
and opposition politicians also accused Nuevas Ideas of "promoting the figure
of Nayib Bukele" ahead of the 3 October 2023 campaigning period for
presidential candidates, and called on the TSE to take action against the
supposed early campaigns being undertaken by Nuevas Ideas.[213] In October
2023, the TSE stated that it was investigating 20 to 25 cases of early
campaigns.[214] On 4 February 2024, four days after the beginning of a period
of election silence, Bukele called upon voters to vote for him; ARENA
criticized Bukele's call to voters, denouncing what the party described as
"disrespectful of the Constitution and the law".[215]

In February 2023, Castro stated that Nuevas Ideas aimed to win 70 seats in the
Legislative Assembly and that the party did not intend to join a coalition
with any other party.[146][216] Following the reduction of municipalities and
legislative seats, Castro stated that Nuevas Ideas expected to win all 44
municipalities and all 60 seats in the Legislative Assembly.[217] Castro's
revised projections were criticized by opposition leaders; Claudia Ortiz
described the projections as "undemocratic", Wright claimed that Nuevas Ideas
"consolidating is a dictatorship", and Belloso stated that the party was
seeking to "concentrate power".[218]

Nuevas Ideas' deputies held events in the U.S. to meet Salvadoran expatriates
and support Bukele's re-election campaign. Eduardo Escobar claimed the events
were illegal according to the constitution's rules about promoting
candidates.[219] Nuevas Ideas held such events in Houston,[220] Los
Angeles,[221] New York City,[222] Uniondale,[223] and Washington, D.C.[224]
When Bukele gave a speech to the Legislative Assembly to celebrate his fourth
year in office on 1 June 2023, a group of Bukele's supporters were present
inside the Legislative Assembly. They held signs with "#Nayib2024" written on
them and banners supporting Bukele's re-election. The supporters also cheered
for Bukele and the Nuevas Ideas deputies, booed the opposition's deputies, and
yelled chants supportive of re-election.[225]

On 25 June 2023, Bukele and Ulloa officially registered their pre-candidacies
with Nuevas Ideas for president and vice president, respectively.[45] In a
tweet announcing their registrations, Nuevas Ideas stated that "New Ideas are
invincible".[53] The party originally scheduled its primary elections for 2
July,[226] but after the reduction of the municipalities was approved, the
party delayed its primaries until 9 July.[227] According to Castro, the
majority of Nuevas Ideass' deputies were seeking re-election.[228] On 9 July,
Nuevas Ideas formalized Bukele and Ulloa's presidential and vice presidential
campaigns.[229] They ran unopposed and won 44,398 votes.[230] During the
primaries, 60 legislative candidates,[199] 44 municipal candidates,[231] and
20 PARLACEN candidates were also confirmed.[232] Nuevas Ideas formed one
municipal coalition with GANA for San Miguel Centro and two municipal
coalitions with Democratic Change for Sonsonate Oeste and Santa Ana
Norte.[233]

Nuevas Ideas began the process of registering its 60 legislative candidates
and 20 PARLACEN candidates with the TSE on 20 October 2023,[234] meanwhile,
Bukele registered his candidacy with the TSE on 26 October, the last possible
day to do so.[235] After Bukele initiated the registration process, he
addressed a crowd of supporters outside the TSE building who were chanting
phrases such as "five more [years]", "re-election", and "not one step
back".[236] The TSE officially approved Bukele and Ulloa's candidacies on 3
November,[179] the legislative candidates by 21 November, and the PARLACEN
candidates by 8 January 2024.[237]

Bukele called on his supporters to win a three-fourths majority for Nuevas
Ideas in the Legislative Assembly in order to allow him to maintain the gang
crackdown during his second term.[238] In a video message, Bukele claimed that
if Nuevas Ideas lost only one seat, the opposition would "liberate the gang
members and use them to rise to power" ("_liberar a los pandilleros y
ocuparlos para llegar al poder_ "),[239] although opposition politicians have
denied such claims.[240][241] In a message posted on social media, Bukele
claimed that people who continue to believe in and vote for the opposition
"does not see, because they do not want to see; they will not change" ("_no
ve, porque no quiere ver; no cambiará_ ").[242] Bukele stated that he was
willing to work with the international community as long as they respected El
Salvador as a partner rather than as subservient, adding that El Salvador
could "change".[238]

### Nationalist Republican Alliance

[edit]

In December 2022, Carlos García Saade, the president of ARENA, stated that
ARENA sought to attain the "maximum number" of deputies and mayors,[146]
adding in May 2023 that the party sought to win more than 25 seats in the
Legislative Assembly and more than 125 municipalities.[243] After the
reduction of municipalities and legislative seats, García Saade stated that
the party sought to win at least 25 seats in the Legislative Assembly and 30
municipalities.[244]

On 26 October 2022, García Saade announced that the party would not join a
coalition with the FMLN to defeat Bukele in the 2024 election. He stated that
joining forces with the FMLN would "deteriorate both parties" ("_deteriorar a
ambos partidos_ "), and that he wanted ARENA to be the alternative for
Salvadorans who oppose Bukele.[245] Although he ruled out a coalition with the
FMLN, he was still open to forming a coalition with other parties.[246] At an
event inaugurating the party's elected leadership on 26 March 2023, García
Saade stated that the party was seeking to form coalitions and that it was
looking for someone to lead the country's opposition as an "alternative for El
Salvador".[247] On 22 May, _El Faro_ alleged that ARENA was in negotiations
with the FMLN, Vamos, and Nuestro Tiempo to form a political coalition for the
presidential election to oppose Bukele.[248] ARENA leaders acknowledged that
the party was involved in negotiations[249] but denied that the party was
forming a coalition,[250] and García Saade confirmed that ARENA had decided to
not form any coalition.[251]

On 9 July 2023, ARENA officially announced that it had selected Joel Sánchez,
a Salvadoran businessman living in the U.S., and Hilcia Bonilla, a
businesswoman living in the U.S., as its presidential and vice presidential
candidates, respectively.[252] Sánchez's candidacy was proposed by the Citizen
Resistance civil movement on 15 June 2023.[253] Although his initial running
mate was Hardy García, the wife of Salvadoran Independent Party (PAIS) leader
Roy García;[254] she withdrew her candidacy because she had received
"threats".[255] When Sánchez's candidacy was initially proposed, Miguel Fortín
Magaña, the leader of Citizen Resistance, hoped that a political party would
accept the movement's proposal and allow Sánchez to run under another party's
banner.[256]

ARENA's primary elections were originally scheduled to occur on 18 June
2023,[257] but were later moved to 2 July[258] then again to 9 July,[259] and
finally to 16 July.[260] The registration period for primary candidates ended
on 15 May. García Saade stated that the presidential pre-candidates' names
would not be disclosed for their safety, claiming that they were threatened by
persons in government and by governmental institutions.[261] On 16 July, ARENA
elected Sánchez and Bonilla as its presidential and vice presidential
candidates, respectively.[181] The party also elected 42 municipal candidates
and 60 candidates to the Legislative Assembly.[244] According to Citizen
Action, ARENA stated that it would not disclose its entire list of candidates
due to alleged threats made against its candidates for participating in the
elections.[262]

On 25 July 2023, Sánchez stated that he would be willing to renounce his
presidential candidacy if it was what "our country and our population wanted"
("_deseo de nuestro país y de nuestra población_ ") in order for find a more
"suitable" candidate.[263] Following the publication of a UFG opinion poll in
late-August 2023 which listed Sánchez as having 4.3 percent support, Julia
Evelyn Martínez, a former professor at the Central American University, stated
that Sánchez was considering withdrawing his candidacy due to his low polling
figures.[264] In September 2023, García Saade stated that he believed that
Sánchez would be able to win the presidency in the second round.[265] ARENA
began the process of registering Sánchez's and Bonilla's candidacies with the
TSE on 9 October 2023.[266] By 26 October, party also began to register all of
its 60 legislative candidates in all 14 departments.[267] On 23 November,
ARENA began to register all of its 20 PARLACEN candidates.[268] The TSE
registered Sánchez and Bonilla's candidacies on 13 November, the legislative
candidates by 16 December, and the PARLACEN candidates on 8 January 2024.[237]

Sánchez stated that the state of exception "has to be stopped",[269]
elaborating that it "opens the opportunity to carry out abuses, corruption,
[and] influence peddling". Sánchez promised to review economic, taxation,
educational, and agricultural policies to determine which ones were succeeding
and which were failing. He described the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender
as "the worst decision [Bukele's] government could have made", stating that it
resulted in the International Monetary Fund refusing to support El Salvador
and the government losing millions of dollars.[270] Sánchez and Bonilla stated
that they would promote investment by "establishing a judicial system that
works" ("_establecer nuestro sistema jurídico que funcione_ "), and Sánchez
claimed that he was already in talks with potential unspecified
investors.[271] Sánchez supports restoring diplomatic relations with Taiwan as
he believes that Taiwan was a "better ally" than China, citing better exchange
student programs and trade deals with the country before relations were
severed in 2018. He opposes reducing the number of municipalities, arguing
that it would result in parts of the country being neglected by mayors.[272]
In October 2023, Sánchez announced that he would upload videos to TikTok that
would make Salvadoran youths want to dance in support of his campaign.[273]

### Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front

[edit]

Following the conclusion of the FMLN's 42nd Ordinary National Convention on 11
December 2022, Óscar Ortiz, the secretary-general of the FMLN, announced that
the party would not join any coalition in the 2024 elections with Nuevas
Ideas, ARENA, or GANA, but the party would be open to forming coalitions with
other parties.[274] On 22 May 2023, _El Faro_ alleged that the FMLN was in
negotiations with ARENA, Vamos, and Nuestro Tiempo to form a political
coalition for the presidential election to oppose Bukele.[248] FMLN leaders
acknowledged that the party was involved in negotiations[249] but denied that
the party was forming a coalition, and Óscar Ortiz reiterated that the party
would not form a coalition with ARENA, GANA, or Nuevas Ideas.[250] Jaime
Guevara claimed that all the parties, except for the FMLN, were seeking to
unify under a single presidential candidate.[275] In July 2023, Ángel Monge, a
member of the FMLN's political commission, stated that the FMLN would not form
coalitions for the Legislative Assembly but would still consider forming
coalitions for the municipal elections.[276] In October 2023, Marleni Funes
stated that the FMLN aimed to win 16 or 17 seats in the Legislative
Assembly.[277]

On 29 May 2023, Flores officially registered as a pre-candidate for the
presidency and Werner Marroquín registered as his running-mate.[278] Flores
was the party's only presidential pre-candidate to register,[279] although
Jaime Zavaleta expressed interest in securing the party's nomination.[189]
Flores confirmed that the FMLN would not form a coalition with ARENA or any
right-wing political parties.[280] The FMLN was open to forming a presidential
coalition with Vamos, Nuestro Tiempo, and PAIS,[281] but ultimately did not
join any presidential coalition.[205] In October 2023, Óscar Ortiz assured
that the FMLN's candidates represented the "hope and future of the
country".[282]

The party originally planned to hold its primary elections on 11 June 2023,
but after the reduction of seats in the Legislative Assembly, its primaries
were postponed to 2 July and then again to 16 July.[259] In April 2023, Flores
asked the party to not select politicians with a "corrupt past" during the
primary elections.[283] On 16 July, Flores and Marroquín were officially
elected as the FMLN's presidential and vice presidential candidates,
respectively. The party also elected 44 municipal candidates and 60 candidates
for the Legislative Assembly from all 14 departments.[284] According to
Citizen Action, the FMLN stated that it would not disclose its entire list of
candidates due to alleged threats made against its candidates for
participating in the elections.[262] The FMLN initiated the process of
registering Flores and Marroquín's candidacies with the TSE on 7
September.[183] On 7 October, the TSE stated that it could not yet register
the FMLN's candidates because both candidates' Court of Accounts of the
Republic were not presented with updated photos, proof of solvency from the
Ministry of Finance was not up to date, and membership forms lacked signatures
and notary seals.[285] On 23 October, Flores stated that he had responded to
the TSE's concerns.[286] The TSE officially voted to register Flores and
Marroquín's candidacies on 3 November.[179] By 11 October, the FMLN had begun
the registration process for all its candidates to the Legislative Assembly in
all 14 departments.[287] On 28 October, the FMLN began registering its
municipal candidates from San Salvador.[288] On 16 November, the party began
the process of registering all 20 of its PARLACEN candidates.[289] That same
day, Óscar Ortiz stated that the party would have considered dropping out of
the 2024 elections if it was unable to continue financing its electoral
campaigns as a result of debts accumulated during the 2019 and 2021
elections.[290] The TSE registered the legislative candidates by 15 December
and the PARLACEN candidates on 24 January 2024.[237]

In October 2023, Flores stated that he believed he would win the presidential
election in the first round, making a second round irrelevant.[291] In
September 2023, Flores stated that, if elected, he would maintain the state of
exception if the country's population supported it.[292] He also stated that
all criminals "will continue to stay in prison and we will pursue all
criminals". Regarding corruption, Flores stated that "corruption is not
combated, corruption is avoided ... in my government, I will not select
corrupt individuals to form part of the cabinet" ("_la corrupción no se
combate, la corrupción se evita ... en mi gobierno no voy a presentar
corruptos que formen parte del gabinete_ ").[293] Flores promised to invest
US$30 million in the transportation sector and reduce the price of
transportation fares for students by half, which would affect around 150,000
students in the country.[294] Flores promised to launch the "Zero Hunger"
("_Hambre Cero_ ") initiative to combat hunger by investing US$60 million into
building three "zero-hunger supply centers" which would distribute grain.[295]
Flores also proposed raising the minimum pension from US$50 per day to US$70
per day.[296] He announced his "Prosperous Municipalities" ("_Municipios
Prósperos_ ") plan to develop and invest in the country's municipalities.[297]
Flores promised to launch investigations into all of Bukele's government
officials if elected president.[298]

### Nuestro Tiempo

[edit]

In March 2023, Andy Failer, the leader of Nuestro Tiempo, indicated that the
party was open to forming coalitions with other parties[247] and confirmed
that the party would select presidential and vice presidential
candidates.[299] On 13 April, during an interview on Channel 21, Failer
confirmed that the party would not form a coalition with ARENA or the FMLN but
was still considering a coalition with Vamos;[300] Vamos expressed disinterest
in forming a coalition with Nuestro Tiempo.[250] On 22 May, _El Faro_ alleged
that Nuestro Tiempo was in negotiations with ARENA, the FMLN, and Vamos to
form a political coalition for the presidential election to oppose
Bukele,[248] but Nuestro Tiempo reaffirmed that it would form a coalition with
ARENA or the FMLN.[250] On 26 July, Failer posted on Twitter calling for the
formatoin of a "Democratic National Union" with ARENA and the FMLN for a
presidential or legislative coalition, but both ARENA and the FMLN reiterated
that they would not form a coalition with each other.[301]

On 31 May 2023, Luis Parada, a lawyer who resides in the U.S.,[302] announced
that he was running for president. His candidacy was proposed by Sumar por El
Salvador. Celia Medrano [es], a human rights lawyer, was Parada's running
mate.[303] The following day, during an interview with Telecorporación
Salvadoreña's _Frente a Frente_ , Failer confirmed that Parada and Medrano
were both running under the banner of Nuestro Tiempo, adding that "it's to
choose between democracy and dictatorship; if we unite ourselves behind this,
we will change what is happening to our country".[304] Parada had previously
sought ARENA's 2019 presidential nomination.[305]

The party originally planned to hold its primary elections for president and
vice president on 25 June 2023 and its primary elections for deputies and
mayors on 2 July,[306] but after the reduction of municipalities, the party
decided to hold all its primary elections on 15 July.[307] According to Sofía
González, the president of Nuestro Tiempo's permanent electoral commission,
Nuestro Tiempo would contest legislative seats in 8 departments and the
mayorships of 19 municipalities.[308] The party did not participate in the
PARLACEN elections as it believed that PARLACEN is a waste of the government's
resources.[309] On 15 July, Nuestro Tiempo held its primary elections and
officially elected Parada and Medrano as its presidential and vice
presidential candidates, respectively, awarding them 100 percent of the vote.
The party also elected 18 municipal candidates and 40 deputy candidates in
seven departments.[184]

In an interview with Channel 9 in July 2023, Parada stated that, if elected,
he would review the necessity and constitutionality of the state of
exception.[310][311] In August 2023, Parada stated that he would suspend the
state of exception, describing it as "nothing more than the current
government's propaganda",[312] and an "illusion".[313] Parada promised to
remove the justices on the Supreme Court's Constitutional Court and restore
the justices that the Legislative Assembly removed on 1 May 2021.[314]

On 25 October 2023, Nuestro Tiempo began the process of registering its
presidential and vice presidential candidates.[315] By 26 October, Nuestro
Tiempo had initiated the processof registering its legislative candidates in
five departments.[316] The TSE registered Parada and Medrano's candidacies on
13 November and the legislative candidates on 27 December.[237]

### Solidary Force

[edit]

Solidary Force originally scheduled its primary elections for 2 July 2023, but
after the reduction of the municipalities, its primaries were delayed for 16
July.[317] The party first announced its primary elections on 5 March, when it
was not officially registered with the TSE as a political party.[318] On 31
March, the TSE officially allowed the party to participate in the
elections.[319] The party announced its elections again on 7 April, as its the
TSE considered the original announcement invalid.[320] Some deputies from
ARENA, the FMLN, Nuestro Tiempo, and Vamos criticized the TSE for allowing the
Solidary Force to register, describing the process as favoritism and
illegal.[321][322]

On 16 July 2023, Solidary Force held its primary elections for the 44
municipalities, 16 deputies for San Salvador, and 1 deputy for each
Ahuachapán, La Paz, Santa Ana, and Sonsonate.[284] Rigoberto Soto, Solidary
Force's leader, stated that the party would complete is primary elections for
the remaining departments' deputies by 19 July,[323] and also stated that the
party could still select a presidential candidate by the same date. He added
that the party would be open to forming coalitions with other parties except
for with ARENA or the FMLN.[324] On 24 July, Solidary Force announced that
Javier Renderos, an obstetrician, would be its presidential candidate and that
Rafael Montalvo, an agriculturist, would be its vice presidential
candidate.[185] The party stated that both candidates had been elected on 16
July.[325] Solidary Force formed a municipal coalition with Democratic Change
for Usulután Oeste.[233]

On 23 October 2023, Solidary Force began the process of registering its
presidential and vice presidential candidates as well as its legislative
candidates for San Salvador.[326] By 26 October, the party had initiated the
process of registering its legislative candidates in nine departments.[316] On
23 November, the party began the process of registering all 20 of its PARLACEN
candidates.[327] The TSE registered Renderos and Montalvo's candidacies on 13
November, the legislative candidates by 8 December, and the PARLACEN
candidates by 30 January 2024.[237]

### Salvadoran Patriotic Fraternity

[edit]

The Salvadoran Patriotic Fraternity held its primary elections from 16 to 20
July 2023.[328] On 27 August, the party announced that it selected Marina
Murillo, an architect, as its presidential candidate and Fausto Carranza as
its vice presidential candidate.[186] Murillo is the first woman to run for
president of El Salvador since Rina Escalante ran with the Authentic
Democratic Christian Movement in the 1994 presidential election.[329]

On 23 October 2023, the Salvadoran Patriotic Fraternity began the process of
registering its presidential and vice-presidential candidates.[330] It did not
register any legislative candidates.[316] On 23 November, the party began to
register all 20 of its PARLACEN candidates.[268] The TSE registered Murillo
and Carranza's candidacies on 3 November.[237]

### Salvadoran Independent Party

[edit]

In December 2022, Roy García stated that the party sought to win between 20
and 25 seats in the Legislative Assembly and between 90 and 100 mayors.[146]
PAIS sought to ally with opposition political parties such as ARENA, the FMLN,
Vamos, Nuestro Tiempo, or the Salvadoran Patriotic Fraternity (FPS).[331][332]

Samuel Tejada, the party's membership secretary, stated that the party would
select presidential and vice presidential candidates.[299] Gerardo Awad, a
former presidential pre-candidate for ARENA in 2019, sought a presidential
campaign with PAIS. In July 2022, PAIS refused to allow him to run with the
party,[333] and in January 2023, Awad announced that he would no longer seek
to run for president with PAIS.[334] Awad invited Mario Vega, the senior
pastor of Misión Cristiana Elim Internacional, to be his vice presidential
candidate, but Vega declined Awad's offer and stated that he did not intend to
seek any public office during the 2024 election.[191] On 4 June 2023, Awad
officially announced his withdrawal from the 2024 election as he did not
believe that conditions were favorable for his campaign, but he stated that he
would prepare for a new presidential campaign in 2029.[188]

PAIS planned to hold its elections on 11 June 2023,[317] but Roy García
contrarily claimed that the party would not hold elections and instead
participate as a social movement in a coalition with another party.[331][332]
After the reduction of municipalities, the party postponed its primaries until
2 July,[317] but the party ended up holding its primary elections on 16 July.
On 16 August, the party sought to hold a meeting with the TSE to discuss the
party's status ahead of the 2024 election as the party believed that the TSE
showed a lack of recognition of its primary elections. The party stated that
it would hold a street protest if the TSE failed to meet with PAIS within
eight days.[335]

On 28 August 2023, PAIS deputy secretary Carlos Molina announced that it
selected José Cardoza, an agricultural engineer, as its presidential candidate
and Irma Sosa as its vice presidential candidate.[336] The party also
presented its legislative, municipal, and PARLACEN candidates, however, Roy
García stated on Facebook that Molina's announcement was not legitimate and
that all of the party's candidates were invalid. He added that the party
should wait and reorganize for the 2027 legislative election.[337] On 21
September, PAIS began the process of registering Cardoza's and Sosa's
candidacies with the TSE,[338] however, on 4 October, the TSE passed a
resolution to deregister the party and bar it from participating in the 2024
election.[187] Cardoza denounced the resolution stating that it was
undemocratic. Meanwhile, Roy García reiterated that PAIS should wait to
participate in the 2027 legislative election as he believed that the party had
no chance in winning the 2024 election and was in danger of falling into
irrelevance.[339] On 13 October, Herbert Vega Cruz, a lawyer for PAIS, accused
the TSE magistrates of committing electoral fraud for deregistering the party
and rejecting its candidates.[340] By 26 October, PAIS began the process of
registering all its legislative candidates in nine departments.[316]
Supporters of Roy García falsely claimed that they had registered "more than
600 candidates" when they could only register up to 60.[341] On 28 November,
the TSE stated that it would not register any of PAIS's presidential,
legislative, municipal, or PARLACEN candidates.[342]

### Grand Alliance for National Unity

[edit]

In December 2022, Gallegos stated that the party sought to increase the number
of seats it had in the Legislative Assembly from 5 to 15. Before the reduction
of municipalities' legislative seats, Gallegos stated that the party sought to
increase its number of mayors from 34 to over 100.[146] After the reductions
of municipalities, Gallegos stated that GANA sought to win 12 seats in the
Legislative Assembly and 15 municipalities.[343] Gallegos initially stated he
would seek re-election to the Legislative Assembly,[344] but then later stated
that he was running for mayor of San Salvador Centro,[345] and then again
reverted his decision again stating that he would be seeking re-election to
the Legislative Assembly.[346]

Prior to Bukele's registration as a presidential pre-candidate with Nuevas
Ideas on 26 June 2023, some GANA leaders believed that Bukele could seek re-
election with GANA rather than Nuevas Ideas as he was initially elected in
2019 as a member of GANA.[347] In July 2022, Gallegos stated that GANA would
endorse Bukele's re-election campaign if he ran under the banner of another
party instead of GANA.[348] On 16 June 2023, Gallegos stated that GANA would
not participate in the presidential election unless Bukele was the party's
candidate.[349] On 26 June, Gallegos confirmed that GANA would not run a
presidential or vice presidential candidate, stating that the party supports
Bukele's re-election campaign.[4]

The party originally planned to hold its primary elections on 2 July
2023,[350] but after the reduction of municipalities, the party delayed its
primaries until 16 July.[317] The party held its primaries on 16 July and
elected 44 municipal candidates, 60 deputies to the Legislative Assembly from
all 14 departments, and deputies to PARLACEN.[343][351] GANA formed one
municipal coalition with Nuevas Ideas for San Miguel Centro and one municipal
coalition with the PCN for Chalatenango Centro.[233] Unlike in the 2021
election, GANA did not form coalitions with Nuevas Ideas for the Legislative
Assembly elections.[198]

By 25 October 2023, GANA had initiated the registration process for all of its
legislative candidates in all 14 departments.[352] On 20 November, GANA began
to register all 20 of its PARLACEN candidates.[268] The TSE registered the
legislative candidates by 8 December and the PARLACEN candidates by 8 January
2024.[237]

### National Coalition Party

[edit]

Before the reduction of municipalities' legislative seats, Manuel Rodríguez
stated that the National Coalition Party (Partido de Concertación Nacional, or
PCN) sought to increase the number of deputies in the Legislative Assembly
from three to nine and increase the number of mayors from 2 to 33.[353]

The party originally planned to hold its primary elections on 5 July
2023,[354] but after the reduction of municipalities, it delayed its primaries
to 16 July.[317] The party opened its primaries on 16 July and concluded them
on 20 July.[323][355] The PCN formed a coalition with the Christian Democratic
Party (Partido Demócrata Cristiano, or PDC) to jointly contest both
legislative seats of Morazán.[356] It also formed a coalition with the Citizen
Power civil movement for legislative seats and municipalities in San Salvador.
The coalition is unofficial as Citizen Power is not a registered political
party.[357] In August 2023, Rodríguez confirmed that the PCN would not present
a presidential candidate.[358] On 30 January 2024, the PCN announced its
support for Bukele's presidential campaign.[6] The PCN formed one municipal
coalition with GANA for Chalatenango Centro and two municipal coalitions with
the PDC for the Morazán Norte and Morazán Sur.[233]

By 26 October 2023, the PCN had initiated the process of registering its
legislative candidates in 12 departments.[316] By 23 November, the PCN began
the process of registering all 20 of its PARLACEN candidates.[327] The TSE
registered the legislative candidates by 27 December and the PARLACEN
candidates on 30 January 2024.[237]

### Christian Democratic Party

[edit]

On 5 June 2023, Reinaldo Carballo, the Christian Democratic Party's (PDC)
secretary-general, announced that the party would not have a presidential
candidate. He confirmed that the party would participate in the legislative
and municipal elections, and that the party was reorganizing its electoral
process to adjust for the reduction of municipalities and seats in the
Legislative Assembly.[359] After the reduction of municipalities and
legislative seats, Carballo stated that the party expects to win at least 10
municipalities and 12 seats in the Legislative Assembly.[360]

The PDC originally planned to hold its primary elections on 14 May 2023, but
later postponed them to 2 July and then again to 20 July.[259] The party
opened its primaries four days early on 16 July[284] and closed them on 19
July.[323] Carballo reaffirmed that the PDC would not have a presidential
candidate and stated that the party supported Bukele's re-election
campaign.[5] The PDC formed a coalition with the PCN to jointly contest both
of Morazán's legislative,[356] as well as the seats for both the Morazán Norte
and Morazán Sur municipalities.[233] The PDC disclosed its full list of 20
legislative, 23 municipal, and 2 PARLACEN candidates on 24 September. Carballo
reaffirmed that the PDC would not present a presidential candidate, stating
"we have not found a Salvadoran who could beat Nayib Bukele".[361]

By 26 October 2023, the PDC had initiated the process of registering its
legislative candidates in nine departments.[316] On 23 November, the party
began to register all 20 of its PARLACEN candidates.[268] The TSE registered
the legislative candidates by 8 December and the PARLACEN candidates on 8
January 2024.[237]

### Vamos

[edit]

On 5 March 2023, Vamos formally announced that it would not run a presidential
candidate or compete in the PARLACEN elections.[362] Claudia Ortiz announced
her intention to be re-elected as a deputy of the Legislative Assembly and
that she would not seek a presidential candidacy.[363] She later added that
winning control of the Legislative Assembly was more important that winning
the presidency and that she would fight throughout the next presidential
term.[364] Sofía Vaquerano, the party's legal secretary, stated that Vamos
would not form coalitions with individuals who had been accused of being
corrupt.[365]

Initially, Claudia Ortiz stated that the party was open to forming a coalition
with other parties,[247] but later stated that the party would not seek any
political coalition.[363] On 22 May 2023, _El Faro_ alleged that Vamos was in
negotiations with ARENA, the FMLN, and Nuestro Tiempo to form a political
coalition for the presidential election to oppose Bukele.[248] In response,
Vamos stated that it would focus more on the Legislative Assembly than on
winning the presidency.[250]

The party originally planned to hold its primary elections on 18 June
2023,[362] but after the reduction of municipalities, the party postponed its
primaries to 16 July.[317] During the primaries, Vamos elected 8 municipal
candidates and 32 deputy candidates for the Legislative Assembly in five
departments. Additionally, Cesia Rivas was elected as the party's new
secretary general.[366] By 26 October, Vamos had initiated the process of
registering its legislative candidates in five departments.[316] The TSE
registered the legislative candidates by 20 December.[237]

### Democratic Change

[edit]

Democratic Change initially planned to hold its primary elections on 4 June
2023,[367] but later rescheduled them for 19 July.[323] Democratic Change held
its primary elections from 16 to 19 July and elected legislative, municipal,
and PARLACEN candidates.[328] Democratic Change formed two municipal
coalitions with Nuevas Ideas for Sonsonate Oeste and Santa Ana Norte and one
municipal coalition with Solidary Force for Usulután Oeste.[233] On 26
October, the party registered all its legislative candidates in 13
departments.[341] By 23 November, the party began the process of registering
all 20 of its PARLACEN candidates.[327] The TSE registered the legislative
candidates by 29 December and the PARLACEN candidates on 24 January 2024.[237]
Democratic Change did not select a presidential candidate, instead endorsing
Bukele's re-election campaign.[7]

### Salvadoran Democracy

[edit]

Salvadoran Democracy stated it would hold its primary elections on 7 May
2023,[368] but it ultimately did not hold primary elections and did not
participate in the 2024 election.[206] It did not register any legislative or
PARLACEN candidates.[268][316]

### Independents

[edit]

Registration for independent candidates began on 5 May 2023[369] and ended on
5 September.[370] Manuel Meléndez was the only independent to begin
registration with the TSE, however, he abandoned the registration process on
16 August.[371]

## Opinion polls

Various groups such as CIESCA, Fundaungo, _La Prensa Gráfica_ , TResearch, and
UFG conducted opinion polling prior to the 2024 general election; virtually
every poll indicated significant leads for Nuevas Ideas in the presidential,
legislative, and municipal elections.[54][372] Additionally, opinion polling
was conducted to ask whether Salvadorans supported Bukele's re-election;
virtually every poll indicated that a large majority of Salvadorans would
support Bukele's re-election.[373] Many Salvadoran Americans also supported
Bukele's re-election.[374]

### Legislative Assembly results

[edit]

Composition of the Legislative Assembly after the 2024 election (top) and its
composition had the electoral reforms of June 2023 not occurred (bottom)[377]

The TSE published the legislative election's final results on 18 February;
Nuevas Ideas won 54 out of 60 seats, a supermajority. ARENA and the PCN both
won two seats while Vamos and the PDC each won one seat.[378] The FMLN, GANA,
and Nuestro Tiempo lost all of their seats in the Legislative Assembly, while
the Democratic Change and Solidary Force parties failed to win any
seats.[378][379] Additionally, Nuestro Tiempo and Democratic Change failed to
receive more than 50,000 votes and could possibly lose registration with the
TSE per article 47, section C of the Law of Political Parties, which mandates
the dissolution of such parties.[380]

On 25 February 2024, Citizen Action published its findings regarding what the
results of the legislative election would have been had the hare quota largest
remainder method remained in place, the Legislative Assembly had not been
reduced from 84 to 60 seats, and the votes from expatriates had not been
considered—the manner in which previous legislative elections were conducted
prior to the June 2023 electoral reforms. According to the group's findings,
the composition of the Legislative Assembly would have been: Nuevas Ideas with
60 seats, ARENA with 7, the FMLN with 6, GANA and Vamos with 3 each, the PCN
and PDC with 2 each, and Nuestro Tiempo with 1. According to Citizen Action,
the electoral reforms only benefited Nuevas Ideas. It also concluded that,
even without the results, the party and its allies would have retained a two-
thirds majority.[377]

Composition of the municipalities after the 2024 election (top) and its
composition had the electoral reforms of June 2023 not occurred (bottom)[382]

All 44 municipalities had winners declared.[383] Nuevas Ideas, GANA, the PDC,
the PCN, Solidary Force, and ARENA all won at least one mayorship, while the
FMLN, Vamos, Nuestro Tiempo, Democratic Change, and the Salvadoran Patriotic
Fraternity did not win any.[384] Turnout for the municipal election was the
lowest since the end of the Salvadoran Civil War in 1992.[385] In total, the
opposition won 1 mayorship, 1 trustee, 24 proprietary aldermen, and 23
substitute aldermen in 16 of the 44 municipal councils; this accounts for
around 10 percent of all municipal council positions. Nuevas Ideas and its
allies won the remaining 90 percent of municipal council positions.[386]

According to _La Prensa Gráfica_ , had the reduction of municipalities not
occurred, Nuevas Ideas would have still won the most municipalities, but it
would not have won more than half of the municipalities, instead winning only
122 compared to 152 in 2021. Additionally, the FMLN and Democratic Change,
parties which failed to win any municipalities, would have won 21 and 1
municipalities, respectively.[382]

### PARLACEN results

[edit]

Turnout for the PARLACEN election was the lowest in 25 years and reached just
29.88%.[387] __La Prensa Gráfica__ attributed the low turnout and almost 10
percent of the vote being blank or invalid to PARLACEN's general unpopularity
in El Salvador, with many invalid ballots containing messages questioning
PARLACEN's functions or relevance.[388]

## Aftermath

[edit]

### Domestic reactions

[edit]

![A crowd of Nayib Bukele's supporters gathered in front of the National
Palace awaiting for Bukele give a speech following his victory in the 2024
presidential
election.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Nayib_Bukele%27s_supporters_in_front_of_the_National_Palace_%284_February_2024%29.png/220px-

crowd of Bukele's supporters in front of the National Palace shortly before he
gave a speech

Shortly after polling stations closed but before the TSE officially announced
the results of the presidential and legislative elections, Bukele posted on X
declaring that, "according to our numbers", he had won the presidential
election with "more than 85% of the votes" and that Nuevas Ideas had won "a
minimum of" 58 of the Legislative Assembly's 60 seats.[389] He also claimed
that his electoral victory was "a record in the entire democratic history of
the world"[390] and that the 2024 election was "the first time in history that
El Salvador has democracy, and it's not me saying it, it's the people".[391] A
crowd of Bukele's supporters gathered at the Plaza Gerardo Barrios in San
Salvador to celebrate his victory. Bukele later addressed the crowd from the
balcony of the National Palace and celebrated his victory in a
speech,[392][393] during which he criticized journalists who themselves had
criticized the gang crackdown and his concentration of power.[391][394] Bukele
also remarked that the election results was "the first time in a country that
just one party exists in a completely democratic system", adding that "the
entire opposition together was pulverized".[395]

Former FMLN Salvadoran President Mauricio Funes stated that the opposition was
defeated "without a doubt".[396] In a press conference on 4 February 2024,
Flores stated that the FMLN would not disappear as a political entity and that
it was "not correct" for Bukele to declare himself the election's winner
before the TSE made an official announcement. Óscar Ortiz thanked those who
voted for Flores and stated that "history does not end here".[397] Flores did
not concede.[398] On 5 February, Claudia Ortiz stated that "democratic spaces
are closing in El Salvador, civil society is closing down and there is an
environment of fear to speak out".[399] On 7 February, Sánchez conceded the
election and congratulated Bukele on his victory.[400]

After the results of the legislative election were published, Flores claimed
that he had votes stolen from both him and the FMLN.[398] Lourdes Argueta, a
member of the FMLN's political commission, stated that the party "did not need
a seat to [...] defend the people's interests".[401] Regarding Claudia Ortiz
winning re-election to the Legislative Assembly with Vamos, Mauricio Funes
stated that she "has fought the battle and I am sure that she will continue to
fight". [396] The Resistance and Popular Rebellion Bloc called for Salvadorans
to "reject this electoral farce".[402] When asked about Nuevas Ideas'
500,000-vote difference between the presidential and legislative elections,
Castro stated that "there is no comparison" and that such comparisons were
"apples to oranges" ("_peras a manzanas_ ") as Bukele was a "phenomenon at the
global level".[403] After GANA lost all its seats in the Legislative Assembly,
Gallegos, who himself lost his seat, stated that he would continue to support
Bukele regardless of his political situation.[404]

After polling stations closed for the municipal and PARLACEN elections, Bukele
posted on X that Nuevas Ideas and its allies had won 43 of the 44
municipalities, claiming that the only municipality the opposition won was La
Libertad Este.[405] He acknowledged that some of Nuevas Ideas' municipal
candidates lost as voters were unsatisfied with their current tenures.[406]
Bukele's announcement came before any official announcement from the TSE.[405]
Milagro Navas, ARENA's sole elected mayor, celebrated her victory against
Minister of Housing Michelle Sol and stated that she would cooperate with
Bukele's government.[407] After the FMLN failed to win any mayorships, the
party leadership stated that the FMLN would undergo a "total
reorganization",[408] adding that "this is not the end, it is the closing of a
chapter".[409]

### International reactions

[edit]

Bernardo Arévalo, the president of Guatemala;[410] Xiomara Castro, the
president of Honduras;[411] Daniel Ortega, the president of Nicaragua;[412]
Laurentino Cortizo, the president of Panama;[411] Miguel Díaz-Canel, the
president of Cuba; Xi Jinping, the president of China;[413] Vladimir Putin,
the president of Russia;[414] and Alicia Bárcena Ibarra, the secretary of
foreign affairs of Mexico, congratulated Bukele on X after he declared himself
as the election's winner.[411] The Chilean and Chinese embassies in El
Salvador also congratulated Bukele before the release of the official
results,[95][411] as did the United Nations.[415] The Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, International Trade and Worship of Argentina congratulated Bukele and
reaffirmed commitment for both countries to work together.[416]

United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken congratulated Bukele on X,
stating that "the events in El Salvador have a direct impact on the interests
of the United States" and that the American and Salvadoran governments could
"reach our maximum potential and surpass major obstacles in our hemisphere and
on a global level" through cooperation. William H. Duncan, the United States
ambassador to El Salvador, congratulated Bukele, adding that he hoped to
"continue working with representatives of the Salvadoran people elected to
fortify democracy, increase economic opportunities, and confront the shared
challenges of the 21st century".[417] Several members of the Democratic Party
in the United States Senate congratulated Bukele's victory, but expressed that
they were "troubled" regarding "unconstitutional moves that strongly
influenced the outcome of Sunday's election" and statements made by Ulloa
regarding "'eliminating' and 'replacing' democracy".[418] Republican senators
Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio also congratulated Bukele.[419]

On 5 February 2024, several foreign news publications called the presidential
election for Bukele, describing it as a "landslide victory".[391][420] Foreign
news publications also described Nuevas Ideas' legislative victory as creating
a "_de facto_ one-party state".[399][421][422] Tyler Mattiace, a researcher
for Human Rights Watch, described the election as a "growing rejection of the
basic principles of democracy and human rights, and support for authoritarian
populism among people who feel that, concepts like democracy and human rights
and due process have failed them".[421]

### Allegations of irregularities

[edit]

Shortly after polling stations closed at 5 p.m. CST, Bukele accused the TSE
and Indra Solutions of preventing expatriates from casting their vote by not
allowing them to cast their vote after the stated time. He argued that people
waiting in line before the polling stations closed still had to be allowed to
vote and called upon Attorney General Rodolfo Delgado to launch an
investigation. Delgado responded by stating that the office of the attorney
general "will prosecute those who committed a crime".[423] The TSE announced
that it would re-open voting at three voting centers in the United States that
had not allowed Salvadorans to vote after 5 p.m. CST, however, the TSE later
retraced its announcement following a petition made by ARENA.[424] Bukele
responded on X to the TSE's retraction by stating "remember this, when the
opposition asks you again for votes in the next elections".[425]

The TSE released the first preliminary results late on 4 February 2024, but
stalled until the morning of 5 February, with its website crashing shortly
before midnight local time. The TSE attributed the delay to "multiple actions
that have hampered the development of the transmission activities of
preliminary results" and shortages of paper to print out vote tallies. It
advised electoral boards at polling stations to resort to contingency measures
such as tallying votes by hand and taking photographs or scans of manual
tallies before sending them to the TSE.[395] Deputies from ARENA, the FMLN,
Vamos, and Nuestro Tiempo criticized the TSE's counting delay.[426] Nuestro
Tiempo claimed that there were inconsistencies between preliminary vote totals
published by the TSE in published statements and on its website.[427] Óscar
Picardo, the director of sciences at the Francisco Gavidia University, stated
that "we've never seen a situation that affects electoral integrity like this
... it's obvious that Bukele has the most votes, as the polls say, but there
are a lot of irregularities in the processing".[391]

ARENA, the FMLN, Vamos, and Nuestro Tiempo all called for the TSE to launch a
recount.[428] On 5 February 2024, the TSE stated that it would conduct a
recount of 29 percent of the presidential ballots and manually count the
legislative ballots "vote by vote" at the José Adolfo Pineda National
Gymnasium,[429] and that the results would be finalized within 15 days.[430]
The recount for the presidential ballots began on 7 February[431] and ended on
9 February.[178] The recount for legislative ballots began on 11 February[432]
and ended on 18 February.[433] During the recount process, opposition
politicians accused the TSE of manipulating the recount to benefit Nuevas
Ideas by including unfolded ballots that were marked in black pen; according
to the TSE's election procedures, only folded ballots filled out in black
crayon were considered valid.[434][435][436]

Opposition_political_party_leaders_in_El_Salvador_%28February_2024%29.png)Opposition
leaders with a proposal to nullify the results of the legislative election

On 6 February 2024, García Saade stated that ARENA would ask the TSE to
nullify the presidential and legislative election results "not because of what
has happened, but because of what will happen afterwards",[437] while the FMLN
and Nuestro Tiempo stated they would ask the TSE to nullify the legislative
election results due to irregularities.[438] On 10 February, ARENA stated that
it would petition the TSE to postpone the municipal and PARLACEN elections by
15 days and to not use the same electoral system that was used during the
presidential and legislative elections.[439] On 13 February, the TSE announced
that it would not postpone the municipal or PARLACEN elections.[440] On 19
February, leaders from ARENA, Vamos, and Nuestro Tiempo jointly announced they
had submitted a petition to the TSE to nullify the legislative elections due
to irregularities and allegations of fraud.[441] Later that day, the FMLN
stated it would do the same.[442] On 21 February, the TSE denied the joint
petition, declaring it unfounded;[443] the TSE did the same for the FMLN's
petition the following day.[444] In response to the TSE's declaration, Failer
stated that the TSE was "ignoring the structural fraud that corrupted this
election".[445]

Although the OAS voiced concern to the TSE during the recount process
regarding the TSE leaving the recount process "in the hands of the
representatives of the political parties",[434] the OAS stated that "the
Mission did not observe actions that would indicate that the will of the
citizenry expressed at the polls was altered" ("_la Misión no observó hechos
que indicaran que se alteró la voluntad de la ciudadanía expresada en las
urnas_ ").[446] Observe El Salvador 2024 stated that it had observed valid
crossed votes for opposition parties be marked as invalid while invalid votes
were marked as valid for Nuevas Ideas.[447] The Interchange and Solidarity
Center stated that it had observed irregularities at 69 voting centers both in
El Salvador and in the United States.[448] Eduardo Escobar stated that there
were "surely" irregularities and questioned how much of an impact they had on
the final results.[434]

### Presidential and legislative transition

wife, Gabriela Rodríguez, at his second inauguration

The TSE ratified the results of the presidential election on 18 February
2024,[449] the legislative election on 18 March,[450] and the municipal and
PARLACEN elections on 11 April.[451][452] The TSE granted Bukele and Ulloa
their presidential and vice presidential credentials, respectively, on 29
February,[453] the elected deputies their legislative credentials on 20
March,[454] the elected mayors and council members their municipal credentials
in late April 2024,[455] and the elected PARLACEN deputies on 25 April.[456]

The elected legislative deputies, mayors, and municipal council members
assumed office on 1 May 2024. That same day, the reductions of legislative
seats and municipalities went into effect.[457][458] Bukele and Ulloa were
inaugurated for a second term on 1 June at the Plaza Gerardo Barrios in San
Salvador's historic downtown.[459] The 20 PARLACEN deputies are scheduled to
assume office on 28 October 2026.[456]

Immediately after Bukele's re-election victory, _The Economist_ indicated that
Bukele may potentially seek to change the constitution and run for a third
presidential term in the 2029 presidential election, as he had previously
stated that the constitution did not "currently" allow for a third
presidential term.[460] In a July 2024 interview with _Time_ , Bukele stated
that he would not seek a third term in 2029.[461]
