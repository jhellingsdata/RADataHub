The **2024 United States state legislative elections** were held on November
5, 2024, for 85 state legislative chambers in 44 states. Across the fifty
states, approximately 65 percent of all upper house seats and 85 percent of
all lower house seats will be up for election. Nine legislative chambers in
the five permanently inhabited U.S. territories and the federal district of
Washington, D.C., also held elections. The elections take place concurrently
with several other federal, state, and local elections, including the
presidential election, U.S. Senate elections, U.S. House elections, and
gubernatorial elections.

Republicans currently control 56 legislative chambers, while Democrats control
41. Both chambers of the Alaska Legislature are controlled by bipartisan
coalitions. The states of Arizona, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, and
Pennsylvania are expected to hold the most competitive elections for
legislative control.[1] Additionally, court-ordered redistricting in Wisconsin
is expected to lead to Democratic gains in both chambers of the Wisconsin
Legislature.[2]

## Summary table

[edit]

Regularly scheduled elections will be held in 85 of the 99 state legislative
chambers in the United States. Nationwide, regularly scheduled elections were
held for 5,809 of the 7,383 legislative seats. Many legislative chambers held
elections for all seats, but some legislative chambers that use staggered
elections held elections for only a portion of the total seats in the chamber.
The chambers not up for election either hold regularly-scheduled elections in
odd-numbered years, or have four-year terms and hold all regularly scheduled
elections in presidential midterm election years.

Note that this table only covers regularly scheduled elections; additional
special elections took place concurrently with these regularly scheduled
elections.

## Election predictions

[edit]

Several sites and individuals publish predictions of competitive chambers.
These predictions look at factors such as the strength of the party, the
strength of the candidates, and the partisan leanings of the state (reflected
in part by the state's Cook Partisan Voting Index rating). The predictions
assign ratings to each chambers, with the rating indicating the predicted
advantage that a party has in winning that election.

Most election predictors use:

  * "_Tossup_ ": No advantage
  * "_Tilt_ ": Advantage that is not quite as strong as "lean"
  * "_Lean_ ": Slight advantage
  * "_Likely_ ": Significant, but surmountable, advantage[e]
  * "_Safe_ " or "_Solid_ ": Near-certain chance of victory

has completely reshuffled the state's legislative districts, leaving dozens of
seats across both chambers with no incumbents. The new maps are more favorable
to Democrats than previous maps, and the party is expected to gain seats in
both chambers, with a chance of winning control of the Assembly for the first
time since 2008.[10]
