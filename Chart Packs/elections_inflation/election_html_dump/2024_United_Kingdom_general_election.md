The **2024 United Kingdom general election** was held on Thursday, 4 July
2024, to elect 650 members of Parliament to the House of Commons, the lower
house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The opposition Labour Party,
led by Keir Starmer, defeated the governing Conservative Party, led by Rishi
Sunak, in a landslide victory.

The election was the first general election victory for Labour since 2005, and
ended the Conservatives' fourteen-year tenure as the primary governing party.
Labour achieved a 174-seat simple majority, and a total of 411 seats.[b] The
party's vote share was 33.7%, the lowest of any majority party on record,
making this the least proportional general election in British history
according to the Gallagher index.[3] Labour won 211 more seats than the
previous general election in 2019, but half a million fewer total votes. The
party became the largest in England for the first time since 2005, in Scotland
for the first time since 2010, and retained its status as the largest party in
Wales.[4] It lost seven seats: five to independent candidates in seats with
sizeable Muslim populations, largely attributed to its stance on the
Israel–Hamas war; one to the Green Party of England and Wales; and one to the
Conservatives. The Conservative Party was reduced to 121 seats on a vote share
of 23.7%, the worst result in its history. It lost 251 seats in total,
including those of twelve Cabinet ministers and South West Norfolk, the seat
of the former prime minister Liz Truss.[5] It also lost all its seats in
Wales.[6] The combined Labour and Conservative vote share was 57.4%, the
lowest since the 1918 general election.

Smaller parties took a record 42.6% of the vote in the election: the Liberal
Democrats, led by Ed Davey, made the most significant gains, of seventy-two
seats, with a total of 3.5 million votes; like Labour, this represented a
decline in their vote from 2019. It was the party's best-ever result and made
it the third-largest party in the Commons, a status it had previously held but
lost at the 2015 general election.[7] Reform UK achieved the third-highest
vote share at 14.3%, with over four million votes, which won them five seats,
and the Green Party of England and Wales won four seats; both parties achieved
their best parliamentary results in history. In Wales Plaid Cymru won four
seats. In Scotland the Scottish National Party was reduced from forty-eight
seats to nine and lost its status as the third-largest party in the
Commons.[8] In Northern Ireland, which has a distinct set of political
parties,[9] Sinn Féin retained its seven seats and therefore became the
largest party; this was the first election in which an Irish nationalist party
won the most seats in Northern Ireland. The Democratic Unionist Party won five
seats, a reduction from eight at the 2019 general election. The Social
Democratic and Labour Party won two seats, and the Alliance Party of Northern
Ireland, the Ulster Unionist Party and Traditional Unionist Voice won one seat
each, and independent unionist Alex Easton won North Down. Many of the record
number of newly-elected independent MPs, including former Labour leader Jeremy
Corbyn, formed the Independent Alliance group in parliament.

Labour entered the election with a large lead over the Conservatives in
opinion polls, and the potential scale of the party's victory was a topic of
discussion during the campaign period.[10][11] The economy, healthcare,
education, infrastructure development, environment, housing, energy,
immigration, and standards in public office were main campaign topics. There
was relatively little discussion of Brexit, which was a major issue during the
2019 general election. This general election was the first in which
photographic identification was required to vote in person in Great
Britain,[g] the first fought using the new constituency boundaries implemented
following the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, and the
first called under the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022.[12]
This was also the first election to be held under the reign of King Charles
III.[13]

The Conservative Party under Boris Johnson won a large majority at the 2019
general election and the new government passed the Brexit withdrawal
agreement.[14][15] The COVID-19 pandemic saw the government institute public-
health restrictions, including limitations on social interaction, that Johnson
and some of his staff were later found to have broken. The resulting political
scandal (Partygate), one of many in a string of controversies that
characterised Johnson's premiership, damaged his personal reputation.[16][17]
The situation escalated with the Chris Pincher scandal in July 2022, leading
to Johnson's resignation.[18] He resigned as an MP the following year,[19]
after an investigation unanimously found that he had lied to Parliament.[20]

Liz Truss won the resultant leadership election and succeeded Johnson in
September.[21][22] Truss announced large-scale tax cuts and borrowing in a
mini-budget on 23 September, which was widely criticised and – after it
rapidly led to financial instability – largely reversed.[23] She resigned in
October, making her the shortest-serving prime minister in British
history.[24] Rishi Sunak won the resultant leadership election unopposed to
succeed Truss in October.[25]

During his premiership, Sunak was credited with improving the economy and
stabilising national politics following the premierships of his
predecessors,[26] although many of his pledges and policy announcements
ultimately went unfulfilled.[27][28] He did not avert further unpopularity for
the Conservatives who, by the time of Sunak's election, had been in government
for 12 years. Public opinion in favour of a change in government was reflected
in the Conservatives' poor performance at the 2022, 2023 and 2024 local
elections.[29]

### Political background of other parties before the election

[edit]

Keir Starmer won the Labour Party's 2020 leadership election, succeeding
Jeremy Corbyn.[30] Under his leadership, Starmer repositioned the party away
from the left and toward the political centre, and also emphasised the
elimination of antisemitism within the party.[31][32] Starmer's leading his
party rightward in order to improve its electability has been widely compared
to Tony Blair's development of New Labour in the 1990s. The political turmoil
from the Conservative scandals and government crises led to Labour having a
significant lead in polling over the Conservatives, often by very wide
margins, since late 2021, coinciding with the start of the Partygate
scandal.[16][17] Labour made gains in local elections: in the 2023 local
elections, Labour gained more than 500 councillors and 22 councils, becoming
the largest party in local government for the first time since 2002.[33]

Ed Davey, who previously served in the Cameron–Clegg coalition, won the
Liberal Democrat's 2020 leadership election, succeeding Jo Swinson, who lost
her seat in the previous general election.[34] Davey prioritised defeating the
Conservatives and ruled out working with them following the election.[35] The
Liberal Democrats made gains in local elections: in the 2024 local elections,
the Liberal Democrats finished second for the first time in a local election
cycle since 2009.[36]

Like the Conservatives, the Scottish National Party (SNP) suffered political
turmoil and saw a decrease in their popularity in opinion polling, with
multiple party leaders and First Ministers (Nicola Sturgeon, Humza Yousaf and
John Swinney) and the Operation Branchform police investigation. Sturgeon
claimed occupational burnout was the reason for her resignation,[37] while
Yousaf resigned amid a government crisis following his termination of a power-
sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens.[38] When Swinney assumed the
leadership after being elected unopposed to succeed Yousaf, the SNP had been
in government for 17 years.[39]

Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay took over leadership of the Green Party of
England and Wales from Siân Berry and Jonathan Bartley in 2021. Rhun ap
Iorwerth took over leadership of Plaid Cymru. The Brexit Party rebranded as
Reform UK, and was initially led by Richard Tice in the years preceding the
election before Nigel Farage resumed leadership during the election
campaign.[40] Edwin Poots took over as the Democratic Unionist Party leader in
May 2021 but lasted only 20 days. He was replaced by Jeffrey Donaldson, who
resigned in March 2024 after being arrested on charges relating to historical
sex offences. He appeared in court on 3 July, the day before polling day, to
face additional sex offence charges.[41][42] Gavin Robinson initially took
over as interim leader,[43] and then became the permanent leader in May.[44]

New political parties who made their campaign debuts in this election included
the Alba Party, led by former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, and the
Workers Party of Britain, led by anti-war activist George Galloway, who won
the 2024 Rochdale by-election in a political upset three months before the
election was called – advertising himself as a protest candidate against
Labour's stance on the Israel–Hamas war and appealing to the constituency's
sizeable Muslim population.[45] However, Alba lost both their seats and the
Workers Party lost their sole seat of Rochdale after Galloway lost it to
Labour's Paul Waugh, having only been an MP for 92 days.[46]

## Date of the election

Dissolution_of_Parliament_2024_Royal_Proclamation_%2815%29.jpg)Reading of the
dissolution proclamation on the steps of the Royal Exchange

Originally the next election was scheduled to take place on 2 May 2024 under
the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011.[o] At the 2019 general election, in which
the Conservatives won a majority of 80 seats, the party's manifesto contained
a commitment to repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.[59] In December 2020,
the government duly published a draft Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 (Repeal)
Bill, later retitled the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act
2022.[60][61] This entered into force on 24 March 2022. Thus, the prime
minister can again request the monarch to dissolve Parliament and call an
early election with 25 working days' notice. Section 4 of the Act provided:
"If it has not been dissolved earlier, a Parliament dissolves at the beginning
of the day that is the fifth anniversary of the day on which it first met".
The Electoral Commission confirmed that the 2019 Parliament would, therefore,
have to be dissolved, at the latest, by 17 December 2024, and that the next
general election had to take place no later than 28 January 2025.[62][63]

With no election date fixed in law, there was speculation as to when the prime
minister, Rishi Sunak, would call an election. On 18 December 2023, Sunak told
journalists that the election would take place in 2024 rather than January
2025.[64] On 4 January, he first suggested the general election would probably
be in the second half of 2024.[65] Throughout 2024, political commentators and
MPs expected the election to be held in the autumn.[66][67][68] On 22 May
2024, following much speculation through the day (including being asked about
it by Stephen Flynn at Prime Minister's Questions),[69][70][71] Sunak
officially announced the election would be held on 4 July with the dissolution
of the Parliament on 30 May.[72]

The deadline for candidate nominations was 7 June 2024, with political
campaigning for four weeks until polling day on 4 July. On the day of the
election, polling stations across the country were open from 7 am, and closed
at 10 pm. The date chosen for the 2024 general election made it the first to
be held in July since the 1945 general election almost exactly seventy-nine
years earlier. A total of 4,515 candidates were nominated, more than in any
previous general election.[73]

## Electoral system

[edit]

See also: Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 and Politics
of the United Kingdom

General elections in the United Kingdom are organised using first-past-the-
post voting. The Conservative Party, which won a majority at the 2019 general
election, included pledges in its manifesto to remove the 15-year limit on
voting for British citizens living abroad, and to introduce a voter
identification requirement in Great Britain.[86] These changes were included
in the Elections Act 2022.[87]

### Boundary reviews

[edit]

polling station on election day in the constituency of Hampstead & Highgate.
The polling station had been in a different constituency before the boundary
review.

The Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, which proposed reducing the
number of constituencies from 650 to 600, commenced in 2011 but temporarily
stopped in January 2013. Following the 2015 general election, each of the four
parliamentary boundary commissions of the United Kingdom recommenced their
review process in April 2016.[88][89][90] The four commissions submitted their
final recommendations to the Secretary of State on 5 September 2018[91][92]
and made their reports public a week later.[93][94][95][91] However, the
proposals were never put forward for approval before the calling of the
general election held on 12 December 2019, and in December 2020 the reviews
were formally abandoned under the Schedule to the Parliamentary Constituencies
Act 2020.[96] A projection by psephologists Colin Rallings and Michael
Thrasher of how the 2017 votes would have translated to seats under the 2018
boundaries suggested the changes would have been beneficial to the
Conservatives and detrimental to Labour.[97][98]

In March 2020, Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith confirmed that the 2023
Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies would be based on retaining 650
seats.[99][100] The previous relevant legislation was amended by the
Parliamentary Constituencies Act 2020[101] and the four boundary commissions
formally launched their 2023 reviews on 5 January 2021.[102][103][104][105]
They were required to issue their final reports prior to 1 July 2023.[96] Once
the reports had been laid before Parliament, Orders in Council giving effect
to the final proposals had to be made within four months, unless "there are
exceptional circumstances". Prior to the Parliamentary Constituencies Act
2020, boundary changes could not be implemented until they were approved by
both Houses of Parliament. The boundary changes were approved at a meeting of
the Privy Council on 15 November 2023[106] and came into force on 29 November
2023,[107] meaning that the election was contested on these new
boundaries.[108]

#### Notional 2019 results

[edit]

Main article: 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies § Notional
2019 general election results

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/2019UKElectionNominalMap.svg/250px-2019UKElectionNominalMap.svg.png)The
notional results of the 2019 election, if they had taken place under
boundaries recommended by the Sixth Periodic Review.

The election was contested under new constituency boundaries established by
the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies. Consequently, media
outlets reported seat gains and losses as compared to notional results. These
are estimates of the results if all votes cast in 2019 were unchanged, but
regrouped by the new constituency boundaries.[109] Since notional results in
the vote counts at parliamentary elections in the UK do not yield figures at
any level more specific than that of the whole constituency,[110] it is only
possible to estimate the notional results, with the assistance of local
election results.

In England, seats were redistributed towards Southern England, away from
Northern England, due to the different rates of population growth. North West
England and North East England lost two seats each whereas South East England
gained seven seats, and South West England gained three seats.[111] Based on
historical voting patterns, this was expected to help the Conservatives. Using
the new boundaries, different parties would have won several constituencies
with unchanged names but changed boundaries from the 2019 election. For
example, the Conservatives would have won Wirral West and Leeds North West
instead of the Labour Party, but Labour would have won Pudsey and Heywood &
Middleton instead of the Conservatives. Westmorland and Lonsdale, the
constituency represented by former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, was
notionally a Conservative seat.[112][113]

In Scotland, 57 MPs were elected, down from the 59 in 2019,[114] with the
following notional partisan composition of Scotland's parliamentary
delegation. The Scottish National Party would have remained steady on 48 seats
despite two of its constituencies being dissolved. The Scottish Conservatives'
seat count of six would likewise remained unchanged. Scottish Labour would
have retained Edinburgh South, the sole constituency they won in 2019. Had the
2019 general election occurred with the new boundaries in effect, the Scottish
Liberal Democrats would have only won two seats (Edinburgh West and Orkney and
Shetland), instead of the four they did win that year, as the expanded
electorates in the other two would overcome their slender majorities.[115]

Under the new boundaries, Wales lost eight seats, electing 32 MPs instead of
the 40 it elected in 2019. Welsh Labour would have won 18 instead of the 22
MPs it elected in 2019, and the Welsh Conservatives 12 instead of 14. Due to
the abolition and merging of rural constituencies in West Wales, Plaid Cymru
would have only won two seats instead of four. Nonetheless, the boundary
changes were expected to cause difficulty for the Conservatives as more pro-
Labour areas were added to some of their safest seats.[116]

In Northern Ireland, the notional results are identical to the actual results
of the 2019 general election in Northern Ireland.[117]

## Campaign

[edit]

### Overview

[edit]

Labour entered the election with a large lead over the Conservatives in
opinion polls, and the potential scale of the party's victory was a topic of
discussion during the campaign period.[10][11] The economy, healthcare,
education, infrastructure development, environment, housing, energy, and
immigration, and standards in public office were main campaign topics. The
Conservative campaign led by Rishi Sunak focused primarily on attacks towards
Labour over alleged tax plans including a disproven claim that Labour would
cost households £2000 more in tax.[118][119]

Keir Starmer used the word "change" as his campaign slogan and offered voters
the chance to "turn the page" by voting Labour.[120] The Liberal Democrat
campaign led by Ed Davey was dominated by his campaign stunts, which were used
to bring attention to campaign topics.[121][122] When asked about these
stunts, Davey said: "Politicians need to take the concerns and interests of
voters seriously but I'm not sure they need to take themselves seriously all
the time and I'm quite happy to have some fun."[123] Party manifesto and
fiscal spending plans were independently analysed by the Institute for Fiscal
Studies[124] and their environmental policies were assessed by Friends of the
Earth.[125]

### Announcement

[edit]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Rishi_Sunak_announces_the_2024_general_election.jpg/220px-
Rishi_Sunak_announces_the_2024_general_election.jpg)Prime Minister Rishi Sunak
announcing the date of the election

On the afternoon of 22 May 2024, Sunak announced that he had asked the King to
call a general election for 4 July 2024, surprising his own MPs.[126] Though
Sunak had the option to wait until December 2024 to call the election, he said
that he decided on the date because he believed that the economy was
improving, and that "falling inflation and net migration figures would
reinforce the Conservative Party's election message of 'sticking to the
plan'".[127] The calling of the election was welcomed by all major
parties.[128]

Sunak's announcement took place during heavy rain at a lectern outside 10
Downing Street, without the use of any shelter from the rain.[129] The D:Ream
song "Things Can Only Get Better" (previously used by the Labour Party in its
successful 1997 general election campaign) was being played loudly in the
background by the political activist Steve Bray as Sunak announced the date of
the general election.[130] This led to the song reaching number two on UK's
iTunes Charts.[131][132]

### 22–29 May

[edit]

At the beginning of the campaign, Labour had a significant lead in polling
over the Conservatives.[29][133] Polling also showed Labour doing well against
the Scottish National Party (SNP) in Scotland.[134] When visiting Windermere,
Davey fell off a paddleboard, while campaigning to highlight the issue of
sewage discharges into rivers and lakes.[135] A couple of days later, Davey
won media attention when going down a Slip 'N Slide, while drawing attention
to deteriorating mental health among children.[123]

On 23 May, Sunak said that before the election there would be no flights to
Rwanda for those seeking asylum.[136] Immigration figures were published for
2023 showing immigration remained at historically high levels, but had fallen
compared to 2022.[137] Nigel Farage announced that he would not be standing in
the general election, preferring to focus on campaigning for the 2024 United
States presidential election instead.[138] However, Farage later announced on
3 June that, contrary to his statement earlier in the campaign, he would stand
for Parliament in Clacton, and that he had resumed leadership of Reform UK,
taking over from Richard Tice, who remained the party's chairman. Farage also
predicted that Labour would win the election, whilst stating the Conservatives
were incapable of being the Official Opposition due to having spent "much of
the last five years fighting each other rather than fighting for the interests
of this country."[139] Davey released the Liberal Democrat campaign in
Cheltenham in Gloucestershire.[140] The SNP campaign launch the same day was
overshadowed over a dispute around leader John Swinney's support for Michael
Matheson and developments in Operation Branchform.[141] Starmer launched the
Labour Party campaign in Gillingham at the Priestfield Stadium.[142]

On 24 May, the Conservatives proposed setting up a Royal Commission to
consider a form of mandatory national service.[143] It would be made up of two
streams for 18-year-olds to choose from, either 'community volunteering' by
volunteering with organisations such as the NHS, fire service, ambulance,
search and rescue, and critical local infrastructure, or 'military training'
in areas like logistics and cyber security.[144] Former Labour leader Jeremy
Corbyn announced on 24 May he was running as an independent in Islington North
against a Labour candidate, and was thus expelled from the party.[145]

On 27 May, Starmer made a keynote speech on security and other
issues.[146][147] On 28 May, the Conservatives pledged a "Triple Lock Plus"
where the personal income tax allowance for pensioners would always stay
higher than the state pension.[148][149] Davey went paddleboarding on Lake
Windermere in the marginal constituency of Westmorland and Lonsdale,
highlighting the release of sewage in waterways.[150] He pledged to abolish
Ofwat and introduce a new water regulator to tackle the situation, in addition
to proposing a ban on bonuses for chief executives of water companies.[151]
Starmer was in West Sussex and emphasised his small town roots in his first
big campaign speech.[152]

On 29 May, Labour's Wes Streeting promised a 18-week NHS waiting target within
five years of a Labour government.[153] Labour also pledged to double number
of NHS scanners in England. On the same day Starmer denied that Diane Abbott
had been blocked as a candidate amid differing reports.[154] Abbott had been
elected as a Labour MP, but had been suspended from the parliamentary party
for a brief period. There was controversy about further Labour Party candidate
selections, with several candidates on the left of the party being
excluded.[155] Abbott said she had been barred from standing as a Labour Party
candidate at the election, but Starmer later said she would be "free" to stand
as a Labour candidate.[156]

### 30 May – 5 June

[edit]

On 30 May, both the Conservatives and Labour ruled out any rise in value-added
tax.[157] The SNPs Màiri McAllan claimed that only the SNP offered Scotland a
route back into the European Union, making Pro-Europeanism part of the party's
campaign.[158] Reform UK proposed an immigration tax on British firms who
employ foreign workers.[159] Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay launched the Green
Party of England and Wales campaign in Bristol.[160] Rhun ap Iorwerth launched
the Plaid Cymru campaign in Bangor.[161] George Galloway launched the Workers
Party of Britain campaign in Ashton-under-Lyne.[162]

On 31 May, the Conservatives announced new "pride in places" pledges,
including new rules to tackle anti-social behaviour, rolling out the hot-spot
policing programme to more areas, and more town regeneration projects. The
Conservatives also unveiled plans for fly-tippers to get points on their
driving licences and other new measures to protect the environment.[163]

On 2 June, Labour pledged to reduce record high legal immigration to the
United Kingdom by improving training for British workers.[164] Net migration
to the UK was 685,000 in 2023.[165][166][167] Labour also focused on national
security, with Starmer reaffirming his commitment to a "nuclear deterrent
triple lock", including building four new nuclear submarines.[139] A YouGov
poll conducted on the same day put Labour on course for the party's biggest
election victory in history, beating Tony Blair's 1997 landslide.[168]

On 4 June, Farage launched his campaign in Clacton.[169] He predicted the
previous day that Reform UK would be the Official Opposition following the
election as opposed to the Conservatives, saying that the Conservatives are
incapable of being the Opposition due to "spending most of the last five years
fighting each other rather than fighting for the interests of this
country".[170]

### 6–12 June

[edit]

On 6 June, the Green Party announced plans to invest an extra £50 billion a
year for the NHS by raising taxes on the top 1% of earners.[171] The
Conservatives announced a policy on expanding child benefit for higher-
earners.[172] Labour also announced communities will be given powers to
transform derelict areas into parks and green spaces. Labour's countryside
protection plan would also include the planting new national forests,
taskforces for tree-planting and flood resilience, new river pathways, and a
commitment to revive nature.[173] Green spaces would be a requirement in the
development of new housing and town plans.[174]

Both Sunak and Starmer attended D-Day commemorations in Normandy on 6 June,
the 80th anniversary of Operation Neptune. Sunak was widely criticised for
leaving events early to do an interview with ITV, including by veterans.[175]
Starmer met with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and King Charles III during the D-Day
commemorations, and said that Sunak "has to answer for his actions".[176][177]
Sunak apologised the next day[178] and apologised again on 10 June.[179] He
made a third apology on 12 June.[180]

Farage was among those critical of Sunak over his leaving the D-Day
events,[181] saying on 7 June that Sunak did not understand "our culture".
Conservative and Labour politicians criticised these words as being a racist
attack on Sunak, which Farage denied.[182] On 10 June, Labour pledged 100,000
new childcare places and more than 3,000 new nurseries as part of its
childcare plan.[183] It also announced its Child Health Action Plan, which
included providing every school with a qualified mental health counselor,
boosting preventative mental health services, transforming NHS dentistry,
legislating for a progressive ban on smoking, banning junk food advertising to
children, and banning energy drinks for under 16s.[184][185]

Labour released its plan for small business on 8 June, which included pledges
to ⁠replace the current business rates system and to tackle the skill shortage
by creating a new public body, Skills England.[186] They also pledged to
⁠revitalise Britain's high streets and a new trade strategy.[187]

The Liberal Democrat manifesto _For a Fair Deal_ was released on 10
June,[188][189] which included commitments on free personal care in
England,[190] investment in the NHS including more GPs, increased funding for
education and childcare (including a tutoring guarantee for children from low-
income families), increased funding for public services, tax reforms, reaching
net zero by 2045 (5 years before the current government target of 2050),
investing in green infrastructure, innovation, training and skills across the
UK to boost economic growth, and removing the two-child limit on tax and
benefits.[191] The Liberal Democrats also offered a lifelong skills grant,
giving adults £5,000 to spend on improving their skills.[192] The party wants
electoral reform, and pledged to introduce proportional representation for
electing MPs, and local councillors in England, and cap donations to political
parties.[193][194]

Sunak released the Conservative manifesto _Clear Plan. Bold Action. Secure
Future._ on 11 June, addressing the economy, taxes, welfare, expanding free
childcare, education, healthcare, environment, energy, transport, community,
and crime.[195][196] They pledged to lower taxes, increase education and NHS
spending, deliver 92,000 more nurses and 28,000 more doctors, introduce a new
model of National Service, continue to expand apprenticeships and vocational
training, simplify the planning system to speed up infrastructure projects
(digital, transport and energy), and to treble Britain's offshore wind
capacity and support solar energy. The manifesto includes a pledge to abolish
Stamp Duty on homes worth up to £425,000 for first time buyers and expand the
Help to Buy scheme.[197] The Conservatives also pledged a recruitment of 8,000
new police officers and a rollout of facial recognition technology.[198] Much
of what has been proposed is already incorporated in the 2023 and 2024
budget.[199][200][201]

Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay released the Green Party's manifesto _Real
Hope. Real Change._ on 12 June, which pledged more taxes on the highest
earners, generating £70 billion a year to help tackle climate change and the
NHS. They also pledged increased spending for public services, free personal
care in England, renationalisation of railway, water and energy, a green
society, a wealth tax, a carbon tax, and a windfall tax on the profit of
banks.[202][203] The manifesto promises quicker access to NHS dentistry and
GPs and reductions in the hospital waiting list. They would also reach net
zero by 2040 and introduce rent controls.[204][205]

On 12 June, Conservative minister Grant Shapps said in a radio interview that
voters should support the Conservatives so as to prevent Labour winning "a
super-majority", meaning a large majority (the UK Parliament does not have any
formal supermajority rules). This was interpreted by journalists as a possible
and surprising admission of defeat.[206][207][208] It paralleled social media
advertising by the Conservatives that also focused on urging votes not to give
Starmer a large majority.[209]

### 13–19 June

[edit]

On 13 June, Starmer released the Labour Party manifesto _Change_ , which
focused on economic growth, planning system reforms, infrastructure, clean
energy, healthcare, education, childcare, crime, and strengthening workers'
rights.[210][211] It pledged a new publicly owned energy company (Great
British Energy) and National Wealth Fund, a ''Green Prosperity Plan",
rebuilding the NHS and reducing patient waiting times, free breakfast clubs in
primary schools, investing in green infrastructure, innovation, training and
skills across the UK to boost economic growth, and renationalisation of the
railway network (Great British Railways).[212] It includes wealth creation and
"pro-business and pro-worker" policies.[213] The manifesto also pledged to
give votes to 16-year olds, reform the House of Lords, and to tax private
schools, with money generated going into improving state
education.[214][215][216] The party guaranteed giving all areas of England
devolution powers, in areas such as integrated transport, planning, skills,
and health.[217][218]

On 17 June, Farage and Tice released the Reform UK manifesto, which they
called a "contract" (_Our Contract with You_). It pledged to lower taxes,
lower immigration, increase funding for public services, reform the NHS and
decrease its waiting lists down to zero, bring utilities and critical national
infrastructure under 50% public ownership (the other 50% owned by pension
funds), replace the House of Lords with a more democratic second chamber, and
to replace first-past-the-post voting with a system of proportional
representation.[219] It also pledged to accelerate transport infrastructure in
coastal regions, Wales, the North, and the Midlands.[220][221] The party also
wants to freeze non-essential immigration and recruit 40,000 new police
officers.[222] Reform UK are the only major party to oppose the current net
zero target made by the government.[223] Instead, it pledged to support the
environment with more tree planting, more recycling and less single-use
plastics.[224][225][226] Farage predicted Labour would win the election, but
said he was planning to campaign for the next election.[227]

Labour's Rachel Reeves claimed Labour's green plans would create over 650,000
jobs.[228][229] The Liberal Democrats offered more cost-of-living help for
rural communities.[230] Davey highlighted his manifesto pledge to build
380,000 new homes a year, 150,000 of which would be social homes.[231] On 18
June, Labour pledged hundreds of new banking hubs, to ''breathe life'' into
high streets.[232][233] Labour also promised a large increase of renewable
energy jobs, backed by new green apprenticeships.[234]

On 19 June, both the SNP and Sinn Féin released their manifestos. Swinney said
a vote for his party would "intensify" the pressure to secure a second
Scottish independence referendum, with other pledges in the SNP manifesto
including boosting NHS funding, scrapping the two-child limit on benefits,
calling for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, scrapping the Trident
defence programme, re-joining the European Union, transitioning to a green
economy attracting more foreign migrants,[235] tackling drug deaths and
devolving broadcasting powers.[236] The Sinn Féin manifesto called for greater
devolution to Northern Ireland and for the UK and Irish governments to set a
date for a referendum on the unification of Northern Ireland with the Republic
of Ireland.[237]

Galloway released the Workers Party manifesto, with promises to improve
"poverty pay" and provide more social housing.[238] It pledged the
renationalisation of utility companies, free school meals for all children
without means testing, free adult education, and to hold a referendum on the
continued existence of the monarchy and proportional representation for
elections.[239]

David TC Davies, the Secretary of State for Wales, told a BBC interview the
polls were "clearly pointing at a large Labour majority", but added that he
believed there was "no great optimism" from voters.[240] A potentially large
Labour majority was also acknowledged by Jeremy Hunt, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, and Mel Stride, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.[241]
Alison McGarry, the Labour chair of Islington North, resigned from the Labour
Party after being spotted campaigning for Corbyn; she resigned rather than
face expulsion for breaking the party's rules on campaigning for a rival
candidate.[242]

### 20–26 June

[edit]

On 20 June, the parties focused on housing. Labour pledged action to protect
renters with new legal protections for tenants. It would immediately ban
Section 21 "no-fault" evictions, as part of plans to reform the private rented
sector in England.[243] Labour also pledged to reform planning laws and build
1.5 million homes to spread homeownership.[244] They would also ensure new
housing is supported by new local infrastructure (public transport,
healthcare, schools), and pledged to build more housing near railway stations
and on the 'grey belt' (disused car parks or industrial estates).[245] The
Conservatives offered stronger legal protections for tenants, including
banning Section 21 "no-fault" evictions.[246] They said they would build 1.6
million new homes (including social housing) with new local infrastructure,
prioritising brownfield development, while protecting the countryside.[247]
The Liberal Democrats offered more protections for tenants, additional social
housing, and more garden cities.[248][249]

Also on 20 June, the Alliance Party in Northern Ireland launched their
manifesto.[250] Its core policies include reforming the political
institutions, dedicated funding for integrated education, a Green New Deal to
decarbonise Northern Ireland's economy, childcare reforms, and lowering the
voting age to 16.[251]

On 21 June, in an interview, Farage repeated comments he had made previously
stating that the West and NATO provoked Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He was
criticised for this by Sunak and Starmer.[252] He also stated that Reform UK
would lower the tax burden to encourage people into work.[253] Farage stated
in another interview that he would remove university tuition fees if he won
power for those studying science, technology, engineering, medicine or maths.
Reform UK have already pledged to scrap interest on student loans and to
extend the loan capital repayment periods to 45 years.[254] Farage also
declared his ambition for Reform UK to replace the Conservatives as the
biggest right-wing party in Parliament.[255]

The Conservatives pledged a review of licensing laws and planning rules aimed
at boosting pubs, restaurants and music venues.[256] Labour framed its 10-year
science and R&D budget plans as part of its industrial strategy, with an aim
of boosting workforce and regional development.[257][258] Labour and the
Liberal Democrats also focused on water pollution and improving England's
water quality.[259][260] Labour pledged to put failing water companies who do
not meet ''high environmental standards'' under special measures, give
regulators new powers to block the payment of bonuses to executives who
pollute waterways, and criminal charges against persistent law breakers. They
also ensured independent monitoring of every outlet.[261]

On 24 June, Labour focused on NHS dentistry and health, and also pledged to
hold a knife crime summit every year and halve incidents within a
decade.[262][263] The Greens pledged to end 'dental deserts' with £3 billion
for new NHS contracts.[264]

The Liberal Democrats launched a mini-manifesto for carers.[265] It pledged to
establish an independent living taskforce to help people live independently in
their own homes, a new care worker's minimum wage to raise their pay by £2 an
hour, and a new National Care Agency. Sunak released the Scottish
Conservatives' manifesto.[266] Starmer discussed a proposed Football
Governance Bill,[267] which will establish the new Independent Football
Regulator.[268] The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have also committed to
introducing an Independent Football Regulator.[269] The Liberal Democrats
pledged to establish a series of "creative enterprise zones" across the UK to
regenerate cultural output.[270]

On 26 June, Alex Salmond released the Alba Party manifesto. It pledged to
increase funding for public services, increase NHS staffing, provide an annual
£500 payment to households receiving the council tax reduction at a cost of
£250 million, increase the Scottish Child Payment, reducing fuel bills, a new
Scottish clean energy public company, and Scottish Independence.[271]

Starmer pledged GP reforms, including the training of thousands more GPs,
updating the NHS App, and bringing back the 'family doctor'.[272] Labour would
also trial new "neighbourhood health centres".[273] The Social Democratic and
Labour Party also launched their manifesto on 26 June in Northern
Ireland.[274] It pledged a 'Marshall Plan' to tackle health, institutional
reform, stronger environmental protection with an independent Environmental
Protection Agency, and improving NI's financial settlement.[275]

### 27 June – 4 July

On 27 June, Labour pledged to reform careers advice and work experience in
schools for one million pupils, committing to deliver two weeks' worth of
quality work experience for every young person, and recruit more than
thousands of new careers advisers.[276] This is part of the party's wider plan
to establish a "youth guarantee" of access to training, an apprenticeship or
support to find work for all 18 to 21-year-olds.[277][278]

On 27 June, an undercover Channel 4 journalist secretly recorded members of
Farage's campaign team using offensive racial, Islamophobic and homophobic
language, also suggesting refugees should be used as "target practice".[279]
In a statement, Farage said that he was "dismayed" at the "reprehensible"
language.[280] Tice said that racist comments were "inappropriate".[279]
Farage later accused Channel 4 of a "set-up", stating that one of the
canvassers, Andrew Parker, had been an actor. Farage stated that Parker had
been "acting from the moment he came into the office", and cited video of
Parker performing "rough-speaking" from his acting website. Channel 4 denied
that Parker was known to them prior to the report.[281] Regarding other
members of his campaign team, Farage stated that the individuals in question
had "watched England play football, they were in the pub, they were drunk, it
was crass."[282]

On 29 June, the Liberal Democrats called for an 'emergency NHS budget' to hire
more GPs.[283] Starmer hosted a major campaign rally,[284] and stated in _The
Guardian_ "if you vote Labour on Thursday, the work of change begins. We will
launch a new national mission to create wealth in every community. We'll get
to work on repairing our public services with an immediate cash injection,
alongside urgent reforms. And we will break with recent years by always
putting country before party".[284][285]

The Greens announced a 'Charter for Small Business', which pledged £2 billion
per year in grant funding for local authorities, regional mutual banks for
investment in decarbonisation and local economic sustainability, and
increasing annual public subsidies for rail and bus travel to £10
billion.[286][287] They also pledged free bus travel for under-18s.[288] The
Northern Ireland Conservatives also launched their manifesto.[289] On 30 June,
the Liberal Democrats pledged to double funding for Bereavement Support
Payments, and to spend £440 million a year on support for bereaved
families.[290]

On 2 July, the Greens announced its £8 billion education package would include
scrapping tuition fees, providing free school meals for all children, a
qualified counsellor in every school and college, and new special needs
provision. They also want to end formal testing in primary and secondary
schools with a system of continuous assessment.[291] Former prime minister
Boris Johnson campaigned for the Conservatives.[292] On 3 July, the political
parties made their closing arguments on the last day of campaigning, with
Sunak stating he would "take full responsibility" for the result.[293] At the
end of the campaign, Labour maintained their significant lead in polling over
the Conservatives, and had endorsements from celebrities, including Elton
John.[294]

On 4 July, less than an hour before polls closed, Sunak's government announced
the 2024 Dissolution Honours, with life peerages being given to 19 people,
including former prime minister Theresa May and Cass Review author Hilary
Cass.[295][296]

## Betting scandal

[edit]

Main article: 2024 United Kingdom general election betting scandal

On 12 June 2024, it was reported that Conservative candidate and Parliamentary
Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, Craig Williams had placed a £100 bet
on the date of the election being in July, three days before the date was
announced. The bet was referred to the Gambling Commission to determine
whether Williams had placed the bet based on confidential information, which
could constitute a criminal offence.[297] Williams apologised for the bet, but
neither he nor Sunak would answer whether he had inside information.[298][299]

On 19 June, a police protection officer assigned to Sunak was arrested for
betting on the election date.[300][301][302] On the same day, it was also
announced that Laura Saunders, the Conservative candidate for Bristol North
West, was being investigated for betting on the election date. Her husband,
Tony Lee, is also being investigated by the Gambling Commission and took a
leave of absence from his role as the party's director of campaigning on 19
June.[303][304][305]

Over the following two weeks, it was reported that dozens of further
Conservative Party-linked officials were being investigated by the Gambling
Commission,[306] including Conservative Party's chief data officer, Nick
Mason;[307] _The Times_ reported that the investigation was being widened to
100s of suspicious bets.[308] On 25 June, both Craig Williams and Laura
Saunders had their support for their candidacies withdrawn by the Conservative
Party.

## Debates and interviews

[edit]

### Debates

[edit]

← 2019 debates | 2024   
---|---  
  
Rishi Sunak challenged Keir Starmer to six televised debates.[309] Starmer
announced that he would not agree to such a proposal, and offered two head-to-
head debates—one shown on the BBC, and one shown on ITV; a spokesperson said
both networks would offer the greatest audience, and the prospect of any
debates on smaller channels would be rejected as it would not be a "valuable
use of campaign time". Ed Davey declared his wish to be included in "any
televised debates", although he would ultimately only be featured in one
debate.[310]

On 29 May, it was announced that the first leaders' debate would be hosted by
ITV News with Julie Etchingham as moderator, on 4 June.[311] Key topics were
the cost of living crisis, the National Health Service (NHS), young people,
education, immigration and tax policy.[312] Sunak said that Labour would cost
households £2000 more in tax, which Starmer denied. Sunak said this figure was
calculated by "independent Treasury officials". Fact checkers disputed the
sum, stating it was based on assumptions made by political appointees and that
the figure was over a 4-year period. On 5 June, the BBC reported that James
Bowler, the Treasury permanent secretary, wrote that "civil servants were not
involved in the [...] calculation of the total figure used" and that "any
costings derived from other sources or produced by other organisations should
not be presented as having been produced by the Civil Service".[313] The
Office for Statistics Regulation also criticised the claim on the grounds that
it was presented without the listener knowing it was a sum over 4 years.[314]
A YouGov snap poll after the debate indicated that 46% of debate viewers
thought Sunak had performed better, and 45% believed Starmer had performed
better.[315] A Savanta poll published the next day favoured Starmer 44% to
Sunak 39%.[316] The debate was watched by 5.37 million viewers, making it the
most-viewed programme of the week.[317]

An STV debate hosted by Colin Mackay took place on 3 June, which included
Douglas Ross, Anas Sarwar, John Swinney and Alex Cole-Hamilton.[318] Another
debate between these leaders (also including Lorna Slater) took place on 11
June, on BBC Scotland, hosted by Stephen Jardine. A BBC debate hosted by
Mishal Husain took place on 7 June, which included Nigel Farage, Carla Denyer,
Rhun ap Iorwerth, Daisy Cooper, Stephen Flynn, Angela Rayner and Penny
Mordaunt.[319] The debate included exchanges between Mordaunt and Rayner over
tax, and all the attendees criticised Sunak leaving the D-Day events early;
Farage called Sunak's actions "disgraceful" and said veterans had been
deserted, Cooper said it was "politically shameful" and Mordaunt said Sunak's
choice to leave prematurely had been "completely wrong".[320][321] After the
seven-way debate, a snap poll found that viewers considered Farage had won,
followed by Rayner, but that Flynn, Denyer and Cooper scored best on doing a
good job.[322] Another debate between these leaders took place on 13 June,
with Julie Etchingham as moderator.[323][324]

On 12 June Sky News hosted a leaders' event in Grimsby hosted by Beth Rigby,
including Starmer and Sunak, where they took questions from both Rigby and the
audience.[325] The debate covered various topics, including the NHS, the
economy, education, immigration, housing and their future plans in government.
Starmer started the event by saying he was putting the country ahead of his
party, bringing Labour "back into the service of working people". He went on
to attack the Conservatives on tax policy, saying that "the Tories are in no
position to lecture anyone about tax rises".[326][327] 64% of those questioned
by YouGov immediately following the debate said that Starmer had performed
better, compared to 36% who said Sunak had performed better.[328]

Channel 4 News hosted a debate on 18 June with all seven of the main parties
focusing solely on the issues of immigration and law and order.[329] Other BBC
debates included three _Question Time_ specials, two hosted by Fiona Bruce on
20 and 28 June, and one hosted by Bethan Rhys Roberts on 24 June. The first of
the two hosted by Bruce featured four separate half-hour question and answer
sessions with Sunak, Starmer, Davey and Swinney; the second of the two hosted
by Bruce featured the same format with Ramsay and Farage; the programme hosted
by Rhys Roberts featured the same format with ap Iorwerth. There was a BBC
Cymru Wales debate on 21 June;[330] and a debate between Sunak and Starmer
hosted by Husain took place on 26 June.[331] There was also a BBC debate on 27
June involving the five largest Northern Irish political parties.[330]

### Interviews

[edit]

In addition to the debates, the BBC and ITV broadcast programmes in which the
leaders of the main parties were interviewed at length.[349][350] Nick
Robinson did BBC _Panorama_ interviews with all the leaders of the main
parties. Sunak's _Tonight_ interview with Paul Brand drew substantial coverage
in the week prior to broadcast, as Sunak controversially departed the D-Day
commemorations early to attend. It was later revealed that the interview slot
had been chosen by Sunak and his team from a range of options offered by
ITN.[351]

## Endorsements

[edit]

Main article: Endorsements in the 2024 United Kingdom general election

Newspapers, organisations, and individuals endorsed parties or individual
candidates for the election.

## Candidates

[edit]

Main article: Candidates in the 2024 United Kingdom general election

There were 4,515 candidates standing, which constitutes a record number, with
a mean of 6.95 candidates per constituency. No seat had fewer than five people
contesting it; Rishi Sunak's Richmond and Northallerton seat had the most
candidates, with thirteen.[352]

MPs who stood down at the election included the former prime minister Theresa
May, the former cabinet ministers Sajid Javid, Dominic Raab, Matt Hancock, Ben
Wallace, Nadhim Zahawi, Kwasi Kwarteng, and Michael Gove, the long-serving
Labour MPs Harriet Harman and Margaret Beckett, and the former Green Party
leader and co-leader Caroline Lucas, who was the first – and until this
election the only – Green Party MP.[353]

In March 2022, Labour abandoned all-women shortlists, citing legal advice that
continuing to use them for choosing parliamentary candidates would be an
unlawful practice under the Equality Act 2010, since the majority of Labour
MPs were now women.[354]

In March 2024, Reform UK announced an electoral pact with the Northern Irish
unionist party TUV.[355][356] The TUV applied to run candidates as "TUV/Reform
UK" on ballot papers, but this was rejected by the Electoral Office.[357]
Nigel Farage unilaterally ended this deal by endorsing two competing
candidates from the Democratic Unionist Party on 10 June.[358] Reform UK also
announced a pact with the Social Democratic Party (SDP), a minor socially
conservative party, in some seats.[359]

All parties standing in at least 14 seats.  Parties[360] | Candidates[361]

Discussion around the campaign was focused on the prospect of a change in
government, as Labour maintained significant leads in opinion polling over the
Conservatives, with one in five voters voting tactically.[362] Projections
four weeks before the vote indicated a landslide victory for Labour that
surpassed the one achieved by Tony Blair at the 1997 general election, while
comparisons were made in the media to the 1993 Canadian federal election due
to the prospect of a potential Conservative wipeout.[10][11] A YouGov poll
conducted four weeks before the vote suggested that Labour was on course for
the party's biggest election victory in history, beating Blair's 1997
landslide. The poll indicated Labour could win 422 seats, while the
Conservatives were projected to win 140 seats.[363]

Halfway through the campaign, psephologist John Curtice summarised the polls
as having shown little change in the first two weeks of the campaign but that
they had then shown some clear shifts. Specifically, both the Conservatives
and Labour had shown a decline of a few percentage points, leaving the gap
between them unchanged, while Reform UK and the Liberal Democrats had both
shown an increase, with one YouGov poll published 13 June attracting attention
for showing Reform UK one point above the Conservatives.[364][365]

## Results

[edit]

Main articles: Results of the 2024 United Kingdom general election, Candidates
of the 2024 United Kingdom general election by constituency, and List of MPs
who lost their seat in the 2024 United Kingdom general election

Voting closed at 22:00, which was followed by an exit poll. The first seat,
Houghton and Sunderland South, was declared at 23:15 with Bridget Phillipson
winning for Labour.[402][403] Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire was the last
seat to declare, due to multiple recounts after the election, with Angus
MacDonald winning for the Liberal Democrats on Saturday afternoon.[404]
Notably, the 2024 election was the most unrepresentative in UK history, with
Labour's number of votes being fewer than it received in 2019.[405][406]

The result was a landslide win for Labour and a historic loss for the
Conservatives. It was the latter's worst result since formalising as a party
in the early 19th century, and the largest defeat for any incarnation of the
Tories in purely numeric terms since 1761 when they achieved 112 MPs, up from
their all time numeric low of 106 in 1754, although those made up a higher
percentage of seats in Parliament (18.9% in 1754 and 20.1% in 1761 as opposed
to 18.6% in 2024) due to the smaller sized House of Commons in 1754–1761 of
557 MPs. The Conservatives won no seats in Wales or various English counties,
including Cornwall and Oxfordshire (the latter historically known for having
several safe Conservative seats), and they only won one seat in North East
England.[410] Keir Starmer became the fourth prime minister in a two-year
period.[411] Turnout, at 59.9%, was the second lowest since 1885 with only
2001 being lower at 59.4%.[412]

The Liberal Democrats made significant gains to reach their highest ever
number of seats, mostly gaining Conservative seats in Southern England. This
was also the best performance since its predecessor Liberal Party won 158
seats in 1923[413] (itself a higher score than the Conservatives achieved in
this 2024 election) and superior to Labour's 1918 and 1931 performances, as
second-placed official Opposition on both occasions. Reform UK had MPs elected
to the Commons for the first time. Their leader, Nigel Farage, was elected to
Parliament on what was his eighth attempt.[414] The Green Party of England and
Wales also won a record number of seats.[410] The party's two co-leaders,
Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay, both entered Parliament for the first
time.[415]

The Scottish National Party (SNP) lost around three quarters of its seats to
Scottish Labour.[4] Labour returned to being the largest party in Scotland and
remained so in Wales, although their vote share fell in Wales.[416]

Because the Democratic Unionist Party lost 3 seats, Sinn Féin won the most
seats in Northern Ireland, making it the first time an Irish nationalist party
was the largest party in Parliament from Northern Ireland. The Traditional
Unionist Voice entered the Commons for the first time.[417] In North Down,
independent Unionist candidate Alex Easton emerged victorious over the
Alliance Party incumbent Stephen Farry,[418] resulting in the election of a
total of six independent MPs across the UK.

Four independent candidates (Ayoub Khan, Adnan Hussain, Iqbal Mohamed, Shockat
Adam) outright defeated Labour candidates as well as one (Claudia Webbe)
acting as a spoiler to defeat one in areas with large Muslim populations; the
results were suggested to be a push-back against Labour's stance on the
Israel–Hamas war and Gaza humanitarian crisis.[419][420] Additionally, Wes
Streeting retained his Ilford North constituency by a margin of only 528 votes
following a challenge by independent British-Palestinian candidate Leanne
Mohamad,[421] while prominent Labour MP Jess Phillips retained her Birmingham
Yardley constituency by a margin of 693 votes.[422] Labour candidate Paul
Waugh won the seat of Rochdale from incumbent MP George Galloway, despite the
consistency's sizeable Muslim population.[423] In Islington North, Jeremy
Corbyn defeated the Labour candidate with a majority of 7,247; Corbyn is a
prominent activist for Palestinian solidarity.[424]

### Proportionality concerns

Proportional_results_of_the_2024_UK_General_Election.svg.png)Seats won in the
election (outer ring) versus number of votes (inner ring)

The combined vote share for Labour and the Conservatives reached a record low,
with smaller parties doing well. The election was highly disproportionate, as
Labour won 63% of seats (411) with only 34% of the vote, while Reform won
under 0.8% of seats (5) with 14.3% of the vote under the UK's first-past-the-
post voting system.[425] The Liberal Democrats recorded their best ever seat
result (72), despite receiving only around half the votes they did in
2010,[426] and fewer votes overall than Reform, although the party's seat
share was again lower than its share of the vote. As Starmer's government was
elected with the lowest share of the vote of any majority party on record,
journalist Fraser Nelson described Labour's electoral success as a "Potemkin
landslide".[427] An editorial from _The Guardian_ described the result as a
"crisis of electoral legitimacy" for the incoming Labour government.[426]

The Gallagher index gave the election a 23.67 score, making it the least
proportionate election in modern UK history according to the index, as well as
the 5th least proportional result worldwide as of 2024.[428] According to
political scientist John Curtice, the 2024 election was the most
disproportional in British history and Labour's parliamentary majority was
"heavily exaggerated" by the voting system.[429] Advocacy group Make Votes
Matter found that 58% of voters did not vote for their elected MP. Make Votes
Matter spokesman Steve Gilmore, Electoral Reform Society chief Darren Hughes,
Reform UK leader Nigel Farage and the Green Party of England and Wales co-
leader Adrian Ramsay were among the figures that called for electoral reform
in the wake of the election. The campaigners said it was the "most
disproportionate election in [British] history".[430][431]

Starmer giving his first speech as Prime Minister

At around 04:45 on 5 July, Sunak conceded defeat to Starmer at the declaration
at Sunak's seat of Richmond and Northallerton, before Labour had officially
secured a majority.[434] In his resignation speech later that morning, Sunak
apologised to Conservative voters and candidates for the party's defeat, and
also offered his congratulations to Starmer and expressed hope he would be
successful, saying:[435]

> Whilst he has been my political opponent, Sir Keir Starmer will shortly
> become our Prime Minister. In this job, his successes will be all our
> successes, and I wish him and his family well. Whatever our disagreements in
> this campaign, he is a decent, public-spirited man, who I respect. He and
> his family deserve the very best of our understanding, as they make the huge
> transition to their new lives behind this door, and as he grapples with this
> most demanding of jobs in an increasingly unstable world.

Starmer succeeded Sunak as prime minister, ending 14 years of the
Conservatives in government. In his first speech as prime minister, Starmer
paid tribute to Sunak, saying "His achievement as the first British Asian
Prime Minister of our country should not be underestimated by anyone", and
also recognised "the dedication and hard work he brought to his leadership"
but said that the people of Britain had voted for change:[436][437]

> From now on, you have a government unburdened by doctrine guided only by the
> determination to serve your interest, to defy, quietly, those who have
> written our country off. You have given us a clear mandate, and we will use
> it to deliver change. To restore service and respect to politics, end the
> era of noisy performance, tread more lightly on your lives and unite our
> country. Four nations standing together again, facing down as we have so
> often in our past, the challenges of an insecure world committed to a calm
> and patient rebuilding. So with respect and humility, I invite you all to
> join this government of service in the mission of national renewal. Our work
> is urgent, and we begin it today.

## Notes

[edit]

  1. **^** Given that Sinn Féin members of Parliament (MPs) practise abstentionism and do not take their seats, while the Speaker and deputies do not vote, the number of MPs needed for a majority is in practice slightly lower.[1] Sinn Féin won seven seats, and including the speaker and their three deputy speakers, meaning a practical majority requires 320 seats.
  2. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ The figure does not include Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker of the House of Commons, who was included in the Labour seat total by some media outlets. By long-standing convention, the speaker severs all ties to their affiliated party upon being elected speaker.
  3. **^** Increase from the notional figure of 200 seats which Labour would be estimated to have won in 2019 with the constituency boundary changes
  4. **^** Constituency was named Richmond (Yorks) prior to the election.
  5. **^** Decrease from the notional figure of 372 seats which the Conservatives would be estimated to have won in 2019 with the constituency boundary changes
  6. **^** Increase from the notional figure of 8 seats which the Lib Dems would be estimated to have won in 2019 with the constituency boundary changes
  7. **^** In Northern Ireland, voter ID was already required at elections before it was introduced in the rest of the UK.
  8. **^** On 29 May 2024, the UK Parliamentary website stated there were 345 Conservative MPs and 205 Labour MPs. However it describes Lloyd Russell-Moyle and Mark Logan as Labour and Conservative MPs respectively at the time of dissolution, despite Logan having defected from the Conservatives and Rusell-Moyle having lost the Labour Party whip prior to dissolution.[51][52]
  9. **^** Includes 24 MPs sponsored by the Co-operative Party, who are designated Labour and Co-operative.[53]
  10. **^** At the time of the dissolution of Parliament on 30 May 2024, eight of the independent MPs had been elected as Conservatives at the 2019 general election, including Andrew Bridgen, who defected to Reclaim in May 2023 but left the party in December 2023 and for the remainder of the 2019–2024 Parliament sat as an independent. The remaining nine independent MPs all came from the opposition benches.
  11. **^** Both of the Alba Party's MPs, Kenny MacAskill and Neale Hanvey, were elected for the Scottish National Party (SNP) before leaving to join Alba in 2021.[54]
  12. **^** Known as the Brexit Party at the 2019 election.
  13. **^** In 2019-24, the seven members of Sinn Féin followed a policy of abstentionism. They did not swear into the house, and did not take part in its formal processes (to do so would have compelled a by-election).[55] The speaker and deputy speakers (at this Parliament's dissolution, three Conservative and one Labour) by convention exercise only a casting vote.[56]
  14. **^** Deputy speaker Eleanor Laing (Con., Chair of Ways and Means) was on an extended leave of absence, and Roger Gale (Con.) served as an additional acting deputy speaker from December 2022 until the end of the Parliament.
  15. **^** The Fixed-term Parliaments Act automatically scheduled general elections for the first Thursday in May of the fifth year after the previous general election.[58] The previous election was held in December 2019.
  16. **^** Debate took place in Gilbert Scott Building's Bute Hall.
  17. **^** Not a debate: Sunak and Starmer separately answered questions from the studio audience.
  18. **^** This debate was focused solely on the issues of immigration and law and order.
  19. **^** Not a debate: the party leaders were each separately asked questions by the studio audience.
  20. **^** Not a debate: the party leaders were both separately asked questions.
  21. **^** Not a debate.
  22. **^** Not a debate: the party leaders were each separately asked questions by the studio audience.
  23. **^** In electoral pact with the Labour Party, all candidates are also standing for the Labour Party
  24. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ These values are medians of a series of simulations, and so do not add together.
  25. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ _**f**_ _**g**_ This figure includes the Speaker as well as the 18 seats in Northern Ireland.
  26. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ This figure includes the Speaker.
