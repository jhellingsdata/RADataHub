**Parliamentary elections** were expected to be held in North Korea in March
or April 2024.[1][2][3] However, it is considered likely they were delayed or
cancelled due to a lack of communication from the North Korean government on
the subject, possibly due to efforts by Kim Jong Un to pass an amendment to
the constitution before the elections,[3] which would define North Korea as
being a separate state from South Korea, with the South also being designated
as the North's "primary foe".[4]

Many outside observers are expecting the elections to be a sham.[5]
