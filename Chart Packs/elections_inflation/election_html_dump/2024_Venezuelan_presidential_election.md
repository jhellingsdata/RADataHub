Presidential elections were held in Venezuela on 28 July 2024 to choose a
president for a six-year term beginning on 10 January 2025.[1][2] The election
was politically contentious, with international monitors calling it neither
free nor fair,[3] citing the incumbent Maduro administration having controlled
most institutions and repressed the political opposition before, during,[1][4]
and after the election. Widely viewed as having won the election, former
diplomat Edmundo González Urrutia fled to asylum in Spain amid repression of
dissent and a national and international political crisis that resulted when
Venezuelan electoral authorities announced—"without presenting any evidence",
according to _The Sunday Times_ —that Nicolás Maduro won.[5]

Maduro ran for a third consecutive term, while González represented the
Unitary Platform (Spanish: Plataforma Unitaria Democrática; PUD), the main
opposition political alliance. In June 2023, the Venezuelan government had
barred leading candidate María Corina Machado from participating.[6][7] This
move was regarded by the opposition as a violation of political human rights
and was condemned by international bodies such as the Organization of American
States (OAS),[8] the European Union,[9] and Human Rights Watch,[10] as well as
numerous countries.[11]

Academics, news outlets and the opposition provided "strong evidence" to
suggest that González won the election by a wide margin[12][13][14] with the
opposition releasing copies of official tally sheets collected by poll
watchers from a majority of polling centers showing a landslide victory for
González.[8][15][16] The government-controlled National Electoral Council
(CNE) announced[17] falsified[18][19] results claiming a narrow Maduro victory
on 29 July; vote tallies were not provided.[20] The CNE's results were
rejected by the Carter Center and by the OAS,[8] and the United Nations
declared that there was "no precedent in contemporary democratic elections"
for announcing a winner without providing tabulated results.[21] Analyses by
media sources found the CNE results statistically improbable and lacking in
credibility.[22][23][18] Political scientist Steven Levitsky called the
official results "one of the most egregious electoral frauds in modern Latin
American history".[24]

Protests occurred across the country and internationally, as the Maduro
administration initiated Operation Tun Tun, a crackdown on dissent. Some world
leaders rejected the CNE's claimed results and recognized González as the
election winner,[14][25][26] while some other countries, including Russia,
China, Iran, North Korea and Cuba recognized Maduro as the winner.[27][5]
Maduro did not cede power,[28] and instead asked the Supreme Tribunal of
Justice (TSJ), composed of justices loyal to Maduro,[20][29][30][31] to audit
and approve the results.[32][33][34][35] On 22 August, as
anticipated,[33][30][31] the TSJ described the CNE's statement of Maduro
winning the election as "validated".[32] The supreme court ruling was rejected
by the United States, the European Union and ten Latin American
countries.[36][37] An arrest warrant was issued on 2 September for González
for the alleged crimes of "usurpation of functions, falsification of public
documents, instigation to disobey the law, conspiracy and association",
according to Reuters.[38] After seeking asylum in the Spanish Embassy in
Caracas, González left for Spain on 7 September.[39]

## Background

### Democratic backsliding and consolidation of power

See also: Economy of Venezuela

The 2024 elections occurred within an authoritarian regime with significant
democratic backsliding under Maduro.[24][40]

Rampant crime, hyperinflation and shortages beginning in 2010 led to a crisis
in Venezuela;[41][24][42] amid declining popularity of the government, the
opposition was elected to the majority in the 2015 National Assembly.[24][43]
Following that election, the lame duck National Assembly—with an outgoing pro-
government majority—packed the Supreme Tribunal of Justice (TSJ) with Maduro
allies.[43][44] The new tribunal stripped three opposition lawmakers of their
assembly seats in 2016, citing alleged "irregularities" in their election,
thereby preventing an opposition supermajority which would have been able to
challenge Maduro.[43]

The TSJ granted Maduro more powers in 2017.[43] As protests mounted, Maduro
called a constituent assembly to rewrite the 1999 Venezuela Constitution
created under Hugo Chávez.[45] Over 40 countries stated that they would not
recognize the 2017 Constituent National Assembly (ANC).[46][47][48] The
opposition Democratic Unity Roundtable boycotted the election, saying that the
ANC was "a trick to keep [the incumbent ruling party] in power";[49] thus the
coalition dominated by the United Socialist Party of Venezuela won almost all
assembly seats.[50] On 8 August 2017, the ANC banned the National Assembly
from performing actions that would interfere with the constituent assembly,
effectively stripping the elected opposition-majority National Assembly of
power.[51]

Scholars have argued that since Maduro assumed the presidency in 2013, the
nation has veered towards dictatorship. Maduro "consolidate[d] power" by
creating an alternate legislative body (the 2017 ANC) to eliminate the
National Assembly and then using a packed Supreme Court to sideline the
legislature and bar the major opposition figures from the 2018 Venezuelan
presidential election.[24][52][53][54]

### 2018 election and presidential crisis

Further information: Venezuelan presidential crisis and Sanctions during the
Venezuelan crisis

Maduro called for the 2018 presidential election to occur months before the
prescribed December date.[55] He was declared the winner in May 2018 after
multiple major opposition parties were banned from participating, among other
irregularities.[56] The election results were widely disputed both nationally
and internationally,[56] and politicians considered him an ineffective
dictator.[40] In the months leading up to his 10 January 2019 inauguration,
Maduro was pressured by international groups and other nations to step down;
this pressure was increased after the new National Assembly of Venezuela was
sworn in on 5 January 2019.[57][58]

Maduro took his official oath on 10 January 2019.[59] That same month, the
National Assembly invoked clauses of the 1999 Venezuelan Constitution to
install National Assembly Speaker Juan Guaidó as acting president,
precipitating the Venezuelan presidential crisis.[60]

By January 2020, efforts led by Guaidó to create a transitional government had
been unsuccessful and Maduro continued to control Venezuela's state
institutions.[61][62][63] In January 2021, the European Union stopped
recognizing Guaidó as president, but still did not recognize Maduro as the
legitimate president;[64] the European Parliament reaffirmed its recognition
of Guaidó as president.[65][66] After the announcement of regional elections
in 2021, Guaidó proposed negotiations with Maduro with a schedule for free and
fair elections in exchange for lifting international sanctions.[67]

In December 2022, three of the four main opposition political parties (Justice
First, Democratic Action and A New Era) backed and approved a reform to
dissolve the interim government and create a commission of five members to
manage foreign assets, as deputies sought a united strategy ahead of the 2024
elections,[68][69] stating that the interim government had failed to achieve
its goals.[70]

### 2020 transitional government proposal

On 31 March 2020, the United States proposed a transitional government that
would exclude both Maduro and Guaidó from the presidency.[71] The power-
sharing deal provided for elections to be held within the year, and foreign
militaries, particularly Cuba and Russia, to leave the country. The US was
seeking Maduro's arrest at the time of the announcement.[72] Experts stated
that the deal explicitly mentioned who would lead a transitional government,
something which stalled previous discussions, and coming shortly after the US
indictment of Maduro, might pressure him to peacefully leave power.[73]

Guaidó accepted the proposal,[74] while Venezuela's foreign minister, Jorge
Arreaza, rejected it and declared that only the parliamentary election would
take place in 2020.[75]

## Opposition primaries launched

Main article: 2023 Unitary Platform presidential primaries

In November 2022, Diosdado Cabello, vice-president of the PSUV and president
of the ANC, insisted that the presidential election be moved forward to the
first semester of 2023.[76]

On 16 May 2023, the Unitary Platform announced it would hold a primary to
elect a single candidate for the presidential election, the 2023 Unitary
Platform presidential primaries, on 22 October 2023. On 24 July 2023, the
application period ended, with 14 candidates registered. [77][78]

### Disqualification of Machado and Capriles

On 30 June 2023, the Comptroller General of the Republic of Venezuela [es]
announced that former National Assembly member María Corina Machado was
disqualified from holding public office for 15 years, claiming she was linked
to alleged crimes committed by Juan Guaidó and had supported international
sanctions against Venezuela. She would be allowed to participate in the
opposition primaries because they were not regulated by Maduro's
government.[79][80][81] Capriles was given the same sentence and barred from
holding office until 2032.[79] Analysts stated that the accusations were
incoherent, as Machado was not a member of the 2015 opposition National
Assembly with Guaidó, having been disqualified by the Comptroller's Office,
nor had she served in his government.[82] The disqualification was considered
illegal and unconstitutional by several jurists, including constitutional
lawyer Allan Brewer Carías [es] and the Latin American and Caribbean Network
for Democracy.[83]

Machado's disqualification from holding office was pending a court
decision[84] when a debate was held on 12 July 2023 between eight of the
thirteen opposition pre-candidates: Machado for Vente Venezuela, Carlos
Prosperi [es] for Democratic Action, Freddy Superlano for Popular Will,
transgender candidate Tamara Adrián for Unidos por la Dignidad, Delsa
Solórzano for Encuentro Ciudadano, Andrés Velásquez for La Causa R, César
Pérez Vivas for Concertación Ciudadana and Andrés Caleca for Movimiento por
Venezuela.[85][86][87]

### Harassment and intimidation during primaries

Pro-government militants tried to attack Machado during a 15 July campaign in
Vargas and prevented a campaign rally in Petare the next day.[88][89] On 22
July, Vente Venezuela denounced death threats to Machado by the National
Liberation Army (ELN), a far-left Colombian guerrilla group, after her
campaign headquarters in Táchira state were painted with messages of "death to
María Corina" signed by the ELN. The group denied being the author of the
threats.[90][91]

Venezuelan fact checking outlet Cazadores de Fake News [es] published
information relating to an operation to discredit Machado, carried out by a
disinformation network which had formerly spread disinformation about Leopoldo
López, Juan Guaidó and other opposition politicians.[92]

Henrique Capriles said he was physically assaulted in June by individuals
associated with the ruling party.[93][94] His followers said Chavistas
attacked Capriles supporters at an August rally, which they said was the
seventh aggression since 29 May.[95] On 27 July, Popular Will denounced that
Freddy Superlano's passport was confiscated by authorities at the Colombian
border.[96] Delsa Solórzano complained in August of death threats, including
messages on social media such as "the collective forces of the ELN are going
to kill you".[97]

On the morning of the 22 October primary, in Caracas, colectivos prevented the
installation of a voting center and violence with a firearm was
registered.[98] Nuns denounced that voters were threatened by colectivos, and
that a voting center had to be moved.[99] Armed civilians entered a voting
point and pointed at the coordinator, firing several shots.[100] Motorcyclists
threw a tear gas cannister in the vicinity of a voting center,[101][102] and
two men fired shots into the air at another voting center.[100]

The vice-president of the Regional Board of Monagas state, Dexcy Moya,
denounced that colectivos shouted expletives and threats in several voting
centers in Maturin.[103]

### Exclusion of Machado and broken 2023 deal

Tarek_William_Saab_como_defensor_del_pueblo.jpg)Tarek William Saab,
Venezuela's Prosecutor General

María Corina Machado won the October 2023 Unitary Platform primary by a
landslide.[104]

In October 2023, the Maduro government and representatives of the opposition
signed the Barbados Agreement. Both parties agreed to hold free and fair
elections, and accept their results, in exchange for sanctions imposed by the
US on petroleum sales to be eased.[105] Despite the agreement, Machado's
disqualification was confirmed by the TSJ in January 2024.[106]

Following poor turnout in the 2023 Venezuelan referendum, the chief prosecutor
of Venezuela, Tarek William Saab, accused opposition leaders of sabotaging the
referendum and issued arrest warrants for 15 of them, with charges such as
treason and conspiracy.[107] Saab—under sanctions for multiple alleged
offenses—is charged by human rights organizations as "being one of the key
people in the regime's efforts to use the Venezuelan justice system as an
instrument of political persecution", according to an August 2024 _Miami
Herald_ article.[108]

Machado and her supporters said they were attacked by colectivos during a
February 2024 campaign rally in Charallave, Miranda state. Machado denounced
that the attack occurred in front of security officials, who did not
intervene.[109] With the main opposition candidate banned from running, the US
stated that Maduro's government had "fallen short" on its commitments, and
reinstated some sanctions in April 2024.[110][111]

Organizations such as the United Nations, the Organization of American States,
the European Union, and Human Rights Watch along with several countries and
their leaders rejected or condemned Machado's
disqualification.[112][113][114][115][116] Antony Blinken, US Secretary of
State, called Machado's disqualification "deeply unfortunate".[117] The
European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy,
Josep Borrell, stated that the disqualification "undermines
democracy".[118][119] On 13 July 2023, the European Parliament passed a
resolution condemning the disqualification.[120]

### Election dates and new law

The presidential election was scheduled to be held in 2024; according to the
Venezuelan Constitution, presidential elections are to take place no later
than December in the election year.[121][122]

The National Election Council (CNE) announced on 5 March 2024, the date of
Hugo Chávez's death, that the election would be held on 28 July, the day that
would have been his 70th birthday,[123][124] with filing of candidacies taking
place from 21 to 25 March[125] and campaigning from 4 to 25 July.[126]

On 2 April, Delcy Rodríguez presented the Law against Fascism, Neofascism and
Similar Expressions to the Maduro-controlled V National Assembly of
Venezuela;[127][128] it passed its first reading that day.[129][130] The law,
if passing a second hearing, would create penalties including increased
sentences for organizations that promote what Maduro's government defines as
_fascism_ ; critics said it would be used to limit opposition to Maduro's
government ahead of the July election.[131][132][133]

### Negotiations with United States

Further information: Foreign policy of the United States

Direct talks between senior Venezuelan and United States officials that had
been stalled since mid-April were restarted in early July, a few weeks prior
to the election.[134][135][29] According to _The Washington Post_ , the US had
been willing to remove _all_ sanctions if Barbados Agreement conditions were
met, but the Maduro-controlled Venezuelan Supreme Court made Machado
ineligible for the presidency in January 2024.[29] The opposition was not
included in the negotiations. Former US ambassador to Venezuela Bill
Brownfield stated that the US deal was "looser than it should have been" and
"Maduro got, front-ended, all of the benefits he was supposed to get in
exchange for promises to comply with in the future. He didn't comply, but he
got the stuff he really wanted."[29] Several proposals to grant immunity to
the loser of the election have been proposed; while the US restarted talks in
the hope of furthering a fair election, the opposition held out "that a strong
showing will force Maduro to the table".[29]

## Electoral process

See also: Elections in Venezuela § Polling procedure

The President of Venezuela is elected by plurality in a single round of
voting.[136] On 5 March 2024, the National Electoral Council (CNE) set the
presidential election for 28 July and set the electoral schedule:[137]

№  | Event  | Dates   
---|---|---  
Start  | End   
**1** | **Call for the process** | 5 March 2024   
**2** | **Special registration day for the Electoral Registry** | 18 March 2024  | 16 April 2024   
**3** | **Selection of members of subordinate organizations** | 20 March 2024   
**4** | **Registration of candidates for the presidency** | 21 March 2024  | 25 March 2024   
**5** | **Electoral Registration Court** | 16 April 2024   
**6** | **Election campaigning** | 4 July 2024  | 25 July 2024   
**7** | **Presidential election** | 28 July 2024   
  
Venezuelan elections are overseen by the CNE, with poll workers drafted via a
lottery of registered voters. Polling places are equipped with multiple high-
tech touch-screen DRE voting machines, one to a _"mesa electoral"_ , or voting
"table". After the vote is cast, each machine prints out a paper ballot, also
known as a voter-verified paper audit trail, which is inspected by the voter
and deposited in a ballot box at the machine's table. The voting machines
perform in a stand-alone fashion, disconnected from any network until the
polls close.[138][139] Voting session closure at each voting station is
determined either by the lack of voters after the lines have emptied, or by
the hour, at the discretion of the president of the voting table.[_citation
needed_]

### Poll witnesses

Venezuelan law provides for representatives to observe at each voting place;
anyone can witness the electoral process.[33] Each machine prints tally sheets
(_actas de escrutinio_ or _actas_[140]) after the polls close, showing how
many votes were received by each candidate, and representatives of the parties
receive a copy.[139] After the secretary of the voting table and the witnesses
accredited by the CNE agree that the _acta_ tally matches the paper receipts
in the ballot boxes, they sign the _acta_ , which is transmitted to the CNE
and signed copies are given to the witnesses.[33][140] CNE typically posts
counts, but not images of the tally sheets.[139]

Lester Toledo, a strategist for the opposition, told the _Miami Herald_
that—anticipating fraud in the vote tally—the opposition coordinated for
several months before the election to arrange 600,000 volunteers into
"command" groups of 10 (_comanditos_) to include "witnesses for each voting
machine, lookouts outside the centers to ensure everything ran smoothly and
monitors who made sure the _actas_ were printed and then taken to outside
locations to be scanned and, ultimately, uploaded to a centralized
cloud".[141] The Associated Press reported that 90,000 opposition party
representatives were trained to use a custom-made app to report results and
irregularities, and had been instructed not to leave polling centers before
obtaining a copy of the tally sheets.[142] Volunteers obtained over 80% of the
_actas_ ,[142] uploaded 24,576 of them, and tallied the votes by using the QR
codes printed on each one.[141]

Following the election, the opposition published a database and searchable
website with images of the tally sheets, which registered voters could
check[8][15][16] and which they provided to international observers.[143]

Parties and countries disputing the government results have urged the CNE to
produce the tally sheets to verify its count.[139]

### Number of voters and voting stations

The Electoral Gazette number 1023 of 25 May 2023 reported that Venezuela's
Electoral Registry had 21,010,514 registered voters. Of these, 20,675,478 were
in Venezuela, 107,836 were abroad, and 227,200 were foreign citizens in the
country. The NGO Súmate noted a decline in registered voters over the past six
publications in 2021 and 2022, with 84,115 fewer voters since the last
publication. They also highlighted that 53,991 voters had objections and
couldn't vote, urging them to check their status on the Electoral Council's
website and file a claim if necessary.[144]

On election day, 15,767 poll stations had been set up by 08:20 am local time,
which amounted to 95% of the total, according to CNE.[145][146]

### Observers

There were very few independent international election
observers.[147][148][21]

#### Carter Center

On 20 June 2024, the Carter Center agreed to send observers in response to
concerns about the lack of sufficient independent monitors, which could
undermine the legitimacy of the election results.[149] It sent only "small
technical team", according to the BBC[147] of 17 experts to 4 cities.[150]

The Carter Center stated on 30 July that it could not verify the results from
the election authorities and that the election "cannot be considered
democratic".[150][151]

#### United Nations

On 25 June 2024, the United Nations announced that it would send four
monitors, following the opposition's refusal to sign an agreement recognizing
the presidential vote's results. The UN team planned to independently produce
a confidential report for the Secretary-General of the United Nations,
including recommendations for future elections in Venezuela.[152][147]

The UN released their report publicly on 13 August;[153] it stated that there
was a lack of “transparency and integrity measures that are essential to
holding credible elections".[153]

#### Other invited participants

Following the requirements stipulated in the Barbados Agreement for
transparent elections with observers, the Maduro administration invited over
600 international participants.[154][155][156] Along with groups such as the
United Nations, invitees were members from the Community of Latin American and
Caribbean States and the African Union[154] and representatives from Iran,
China, Russia and Nicaragua, among others.[155]

BBC News stated that Maduro "welcomed hundreds of guests from countries allied
with his government, who he says will 'accompany' the vote."[147] Argentina's
_Clarin_ newspaper wrote that some invited envoys "were allowed entry on the
condition that they belong to leftist organizations and not criticize the
government", stating that "The observers are limited and cannot declare or
express their opinion within Venezuela."[155]

According to France 24, "numerous international actors, who were expected to
participate in the oversight" stated that "Chavismo has revoked their
accreditations, while the opposition denounce[d] obstacles for their guests",
adding that "not all actors accredited to verify the functioning of Venezuelan
democracy have the same powers" and that the "Carter Center and the United
Nations mission were the only missions accredited to carry out mere technical
observation work, that is, limited."[154]

_Infobae_ wrote that the guests received as observers were "allies" of the
Maduro administration who would not criticize, while others were not allowed
to enter.[157]

#### European Union

On 28 May 2024, the CNE revoked its invitation for observers from the European
Union, citing existing sanctions against Elvis Amoroso, the head of the CNE
and a Maduro ally.[147][158]

After the European Parliament passed a resolution condemning the political
disqualification of opposition pre-candidate María Corina Machado, the
president of the pro-government National Assembly, Jorge Rodríguez, declared
on 13 July 2023 that the Venezuelan government would not allow a European
Union electoral observation mission.[159][160][161]

#### Argentina and Brazil

On 17 July 2024, the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) of Brazil, which had
previously rejected the invitation from Maduro's government to send observers,
announced a reversal of its decision, stating that it would send two
observers.[162]

On 22 July 2024, Brazilian President Lula da Silva stated: "If Maduro wants to
contribute for growth to return to Venezuela, for people who left Venezuela to
come back and to establish a state of economic growth, he needs to respect the
democratic process." Lula, who had previously refused to openly criticize
Maduro, said he would send former foreign minister Celso Amorim to watch the
election.[163]

On 24 July 2024, TSE announced it would no longer send observers to the
election in light of statements by Maduro in which, without proof, he accused
the Brazilian electoral system of not being auditable.[164][165] Nonetheless,
Brazil's observation went on as planned.[166]

Former Argentine president Alberto Fernández was uninvited to observe after
agreeing with Lula.[147][167]

#### Other countries

Spanish left-wing parties Podemos, United Left, Galician Nationalist Bloc and
EH Bildu sent observers.[168] Officials from Spain (ten members of its
parliament), Portugal,[169] and Colombia (senator Angelica Lozano) said they
were denied entry to Venezuela days before the election.[170]

A Copa Airlines flight from Panama[171] bound for Caracas the day before the
vote with former presidents Mireya Moscoso (Panama), Miguel Angel Rodriguez
(Costa Rica), Jorge Quiroga (Bolivia) and Vicente Fox (Mexico), as well as
Marta Lucia Ramirez (former Colombian vice president), was unable to depart
Panama until the former officials deplaned.[170][172][173]

Chilean Senators Felipe Kast and Rojo Edwards were deported by Venezuelan
authorities a day after arriving to observe the vote.[174] Francisco Paoltroni
[es], president of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Argentine Senate,
invited by the opposition for the election, was also deported.[175] Former
Mayor of Bogotá, Claudia López, was also expelled from Venezuela after
arriving to observe the election.[176] Uruguayan deputy Pablo Viana was
deported from Venezuela after being invited by the opposition to attend the
election.[177]

Colombia was invited but did not send observers, with officials stating that
the timing of the electoral process was inadequate for technical
preparations.[178]

## Candidates

### United Socialist Party of Venezuela

On 16 March 2024, the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) announced
that incumbent Maduro would be their candidate in the presidential election,
making it his third run for a six-year term.[179] Maduro officially registered
his candidacy on 25 March.[180]

Maduro stated in July that there would be a bloodbath or civil war if he lost
the election, and that his party would win "by hook or by
crook".[181][182][183]

### Unitary Platform

The preliminary winner of the 22 October 2023 Unitary Platform presidential
primaries was Machado, sweeping more than 90% of the vote. On 23 October, the
second electoral bulletin of the National Primary Commission stated that with
92.65% counted, Machado won more than 90% of the votes and would be the
candidate for the Unitary Platform for the 2024 presidential election.[77]

After her disqualification by the TSJ, on 22 March 2024, Machado announced
that historian and professor Corina Yoris would be the replacement
candidate.[184]

Yoris was unable to officially register in the election; Unitary Platform
representatives said that the electoral commission had blocked her
registration. Following outcry from countries including the US, Brazil,
Colombia, and Guatemala the Unitary Platform registered former diplomat
Edmundo González Urrutia as its temporary candidate pending the selection of
another one.[185]

### A New Era withdraws

Zulia Governor Manuel Rosales, founder of A New Era party,[186] launched a
last-minute candidacy in March, taking the Unitary Platform by surprise,
although he indicated he would cede his position to a unified opposition
candidate.[187] Rosales is known as a more moderate opposition candidate who
has negotiated with the Maduro government; he recognized Maduro's contested
2018 election and condemned sanctions on Venezuela enacted by the United
States.[188] In what an _Americas Quarterly_ article described as "Venezuela’s
long-standing political crisis", the appearance of a candidate "distrusted by
others in the opposition as a pro-system contender" seemed to lower the
chances a united opposition could defeat Maduro.[186] According to an article
published by Deutsche Welle, his candidacy led to an "uproar" in which
"Machado accused him of treason".[189]

On 19 April 2024, a day before the deadline to register an opposition
candidate,[190] Omar Barboza, executive secretary of the PUD and president of
A New Era, announced that, after a unanimous vote in support of a unity
candidate, Rosales would withdraw from the race and endorse Edmundo González,
uniting the PUD around a single candidate.[191][192][193]

### Other candidates

The Democratic Alliance did not participate in the primary.[197]

Eleven candidates without significant representation were registered following
the Maduro administration's veto of opposition candidates Machado and
Corina.[198] Authorities allowed the registration of candidates considered to
be collaborators, false opposition, and politicians aligned with the
Bolivarian strategy for the July 2024 presidential election, while blocking
genuine opposition candidates.[199] Among these candidates are individuals
with ties to Chavismo and diverse figures such as a comedian and an
evangelical pastor.[198]

Luis Eduardo Martínez, a deputy for Acción Democrática, has held positions as
governor and councilor.[198] Daniel Ceballos [es], former mayor of San
Cristóbal, has been favored by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice (TSJ).[198]
Antonio Ecarri [es], with a background in education and public management, has
declined multiple candidacies in his political career.[198] Juan Carlos
Alvarado, Secretary-General of COPEI, was appointed by the TSJ and has
validated chavismo control of the Parliament.[198] Benjamín Rausseo, a
comedian and businessman, has made previous attempts for public office. Javier
Bertucci, an evangelical pastor and deputy, has a criminal record related to
diesel smuggling. José Brito, a former member of Primero Justicia, has been
accused of corruption and collaborating with the administration to prevent the
re-election of Juan Guaidó.[198] Claudio Fermín, with extensive political
experience and positions in the Executive Branch, has been an unsuccessful
presidential candidate several times. Luis Ratti, a businessman and preacher,
requested the suspension of opposition primaries. Enrique Márquez, a former
rector of the National Electoral Council (CNE), has held seats in the National
Assembly and served as its vice president (2016–2017, after the electoral
victory of the opposition).

## Conduct and irregularities

### Disqualification of political parties

On 17 March, the CNE disqualified 16 political parties from nominating
candidates in the presidential election, after not reaching 1% of the minimum
votes in the 2021 Venezuelan regional elections, without offering a validation
or repair process required by electoral law. The parties disqualified
included:[206][207] Adelante, Centrados, Única, National Convergence, Suma
País, Encuentro Ciudadano, Generación Independiente (Gente), Partido Unión y
Entendimiento (Puente), Movimiento al Socialismo (Venezuela) (MAS), Fuerza del
Cambio (FDC), Nueva Visión para mi País (Nuvipa), Unidad Política Popular 89
(UPP-89), Unión y Progreso (Venezuela), Prociudadanos (LPC), Compromiso País
(Compa).

### Blocking of the CNE portal

Following the end of the registration period for candidates on 25 March,
Machado said that the Unitary Platform was prevented from registering Corina
Yoris's candidacy, and Rosales said that he did not represent the Unitary
Platform.[208] Shortly afterwards, the CNE, following international pressure,
authorized a 12-hour extension to register candidates, which enabled the
Unitary Platform card to provisionally register its candidate, Edmundo
González Urrutia.[209]

### Obstruction in overseas voting

Bridge

The requirements for voters to register abroad were restrictive and not
contemplated in the constitution. Requirements included a current passport
(one of the most expensive in the world to obtain) and having permanent
residence; the majority of voters abroad had Temporary Permission to Stay or
Permission for Temporary Protection, and did not have residence, consequently,
very few were registered.[210]

On 16 April, registration and updating of the Electoral Registry of Venezuela
concluded. With approximately 7.7 million Venezuelans abroad, 80% of whom have
the right to vote, the CNE only authorized some consulates to hold
registration; many Venezuelans could not register because there was no
authorized consulate or it was very far from their location. In many of the
consulates, delays were observed and the CNE registered little political
interest in solving the problem; the majority of voters abroad register an
opposition tendency.[211] David Smolansky, former mayor of El Hatillo, accused
the administration of blocking the registration of at least 4.5 million
Venezuelans abroad through "a policy of systematic and generalized
discrimination" as well as its "requirements to register and change residence
address" that led to "queues at the consulates".[212]

The special day for voter registration abroad was marred by delays in the
process of up to five days, as occurred in Spain, Argentina, Peru and Chile.
Citizens complained that they were not able to register or update their
data.[210]

According to a 2 May preliminary CNE report, of the almost 7.7 million
Venezuelans abroad, only 69,189 were allowed to vote, of which only 6,020
managed to change their voting center in Venezuela to the country where they
reside. The number of new people registered to vote abroad was negligible due
to the requirements imposed by the CNE and the Foreign Ministry: in Mexico 69
people managed to register as new voters, in Spain 97, in Argentina 27, in
Colombia only 25, in Ecuador 13 and in Peru only six. The exact total number
of citizens able to vote was 21,402,220.[213][214]

In mid-June the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) demanded
that Venezuela "adopt the necessary measures" to guarantee the right to vote
for compatriots abroad for the presidential elections, stating that "a genuine
commitment to democracy requires that the State immediately reestablish the
separation and independence of public powers".[215]

### Harassment, intimidation and other irregularities

Along with the issues in overseas voter registration and voting that
"effectively disenfranchised most of the migrant population", the Carter
Center listed other problems with the electoral process. Checkpoints were
placed near polling stations to intimidate voters. Individuals and companies
providing services to the opposition were harassed and intimidated. The TSJ
replaced the leadership of opposition political parties with those who
supported Maduro. The Maduro campaign frequently used government vehicles and
social programs to promote their campaign.[33][151]

_The New York Times_ stated that irregularities on election day throughout the
country "provoked fury". Intimidation of voters with violence and threats, and
by state forces, included an example in Cumaná, where dozens of armed
authorities lined up at a polling station. In one city, voters reported that
government security forces tried to replace designated witnesses with their
own personnel. The Venezuelan Electoral Observatory said that 17,000 voters
found their polling place changed at the last minute; a _New York Times_
reporter was detained after trying to enter an unofficial polling place.
Voting centers stayed open past the required closing time to allow Maduro
supporters to round up more votes. Some voting centers refused to print the
vote tallies as required by law.[216] Between January and 26 July 2024, Foro
Penal said that 135 individuals associated with the González campaign had been
arrested.[217]

According to Lester Toledo, as the polls were about to close, "he received
reports from about 90% of the volunteers that the government had ordered
election workers to not print the _actas_. But after a tense period of back-
and-forth, soldiers with the national guard allowed most volunteers to take
the actas home anyway."[141] Inside the CNE as the machine vote tallies were
being received, the two witnesses from the opposition were denied entry, and
according to the _Miami Herald_ , "Enrique Marquez, one of a handful of
presidential candidates, said his own campaign monitor was allowed in the room
and reported that the Council did not print the results of the election."[141]

### Violence

Pares (the Colombian Peace & Reconciliation Foundation) released three reports
on violence that occurred during the elections.[108][218][219] The reports
encompassed the time periods:

  1. 5 March to 25 May[220]
  2. 26 May to 26 June[221]
  3. 27 June to 28 July[222]

In the first report, Pares stated there were 25 incidents with 38 victims, of
which 17 were affiliated with Vente Venezuela.[219] Pares found Venezuelan
armed and security forces responsible for the majority, and stated that "no
possible victims of political-electoral violence who are part of the official
parties or the government bloc of Venezuela were found".[219] In its third
report (27 June to 28 July) Pares stated that most of the victims were
"members of the main opposition parties", along with 10 journalists, and that
over 91% of the violent acts that affected 129 victims were committed by
Venezuelan security forces.[108][222][218]

### CNE rectors

In August 2023, the NGO Súmate denounced that at least 92 candidates for
rectors of the CNE were linked to Chavismo, pointing out that Article 9 of the
Organic Law of Electoral Processes prohibits members of the Council to have
any political affiliation. Sumate also stated that one of the nominees had
been convicted for homicide and extortion in 1998, that 46 candidates repeated
the candidacy after running in 2021 and that by that time they were deputies
of the pro-government National Assembly.[223] On 15 August, the pro-government
National Assembly declared itself in permanent session to appoint the new CNE
rectors.[224]

### Censorship

Further information: Censorship in Venezuela

_TechRadar_ reported that websites, including Wikipedia and voting information
websites, were blocked in Venezuela beginning on 28 July.[225]

VE Sin Filtro [es], a non-governmental organization that monitors internet
censorship, reported that more than 60 news providers are blocked in
Venezuela, including 17 new sites that were blocked after the election
campaigns started.[226][227]

### Ex Clé

The sanctioned Argentine firm Ex Clé provided the technological platform for
voting in the presidential election.[228][229] Significant transactions moving
from Venezuela through Ex Clé's accounts in banks in Uruguay and the United
States triggered alerts from Argentina's Anti-Money Laundering Unit.[228] The
firm, which owns the voting machines and electronic counting software, came
under suspicion, according to _Infobae_ , when the Argentine anti-money
laundering unit reported "the triangulation of funds (by EX Clé) through third
countries without apparent economic justification" and "transfers abroad whose
destinations could be questionable", among other concerns according to
Argentine Law No. 25,246 on money laundering.[228]

## Endorsements

Main article: List of endorsements in the 2024 Venezuelan presidential
election

After she was barred from running, Machado's endorsement of González was an
important factor in the election[230] as he gained support from even former
socialist supporters of the government,[231] along with support from the
Machado-led opposition.[232][233]

## Opinion polls

Further information: Polls in Venezuela

As of July 2024, most polls favored González to win by a wide margin; this
trend was particularly true from the higher-quality pollsters in
Venezuela.[234][235][236][237][238][239][240]

### Alleged manipulation of polls

Election_campaign_2024_Venezuela_09.jpg)Election campaign of González

During the run-up to the election, several news outlets reported on the
proliferation of polls favoring Maduro published since May 2024 by previously
unknown polling firms,[241][242][243] fuelling concerns that some polls were
being used as propaganda tools by Chavismo.[244] These poll results differed
significantly from those published by more traditional pollsters, which showed
Maduro trailing.[242]

According to Medianálisis, Efecto Cocuyo, Cazadores de Fake News and Probox,
working with the Latin American Center for Investigative Journalism, these
polls were being used to discredit opposition candidates[243][242] Polls
showing Maduro ahead were predominantly disseminated by media outlets claimed
to be pro-Maduro, such as Globovisión, El Universal, Venezuela News [es],
Correo del Orinoco and NotiTarde.[245]

Six pollsters consistently placed opposition candidate González in first
place, while others placed Maduro in front. Well-known pollsters in the
Venezuelan political sphere, such as Datanálisis, Datincorp, Delphos, and
Consultores 21, along with the emerging Poder y Estrategia, indicated that
Urrutia had more than 50% of voting intentions.[244] Results by lesser-known
firms Hinterlaces, ICS Latam, IMC Orientación, and DataViva, among others,
showed Maduro with between 54% and 70% of votes.[244] Results by CECA
Consultores showed a technical tie slightly favoring the opposition.[244]

On 28 May, Colombian newspaper _El Tiempo_ named IdeaDatos and Data Viva as
examples of suspicious pollsters.[241] NTN24 singled out Insight in June 2024,
writing that "Eight of ten [recent] polls give the winner to the opposition
candidate, Edmundo González Urrutia, and the only two that give victory to ...
Maduro, are unknown firms and their social media accounts are recent", adding
that IdeaDatos and PoliAnalítico "actively campaign for Nicolás
Maduro".[242][246]

Venezuelan independent journalism website Efecto Cocuyo published several
detailed exposés of pollsters, alleging faulty methodology, systematic bias in
favor of Maduro, and repeated dissemination of their polls by pro-Maduro
outlets. Polling firms alleged to be unreliable include IdeaDatos, CMIDE,
Parametrica, Hinterlaces, IMC Orientación, and ICS Latam.[247][248][249]

### Exit polls

An exit poll by Edison Research—which, according to _The Guardian_ , "conducts
high-profile election polling in the US and other countries"—gave González 65%
of the vote and Maduro 31%.[250][251]

## Results

Wikimedia Commons has media related to Tally sheets of the Vote Count for the
2024 Presidential Elections in Venezuela.

According to _The New York Times_ , "Maduro was declared the winner in a
presidential vote ... marred by irregularities"; these irregularities included
"polling places [that] refused to release paper tallies of the electronic vote
count, and ... widespread reports of fraud and voter intimidation", results
that varied "wildly" from public opinion polls and voting center samples,
"major irregularities and problems at those voting centers", and blocking of
legal monitors from polling places.[286]

The Carter Center, which sent a small team of observers, stated that there was
a "complete lack of transparency" and that the election "did not meet
international standards", "cannot be considered democratic", and had occurred
in "an environment of restricted freedoms" and "clear bias" from electoral
authorities; they could not verify the results from the electoral
authority.[150][151]

The United Nations sent a small panel of experts who spent a month in Caracas,
and was expected to produce only a confidential report for internal purposes.
It released its report publicly on 13 August, and according to the Associated
Press, "harshly criticized" the CNE for declaring Maduro the winner before
having table-level results.[21] The report stated that the premature
declaration of a winner "had no precedent in contemporary democratic
elections", and that the election process lacked “basic transparency and
integrity".[153] It concluded that the tally sheets produced by the opposition
appeared to have security features that indicate "a key transparency safeguard
may be available, as intended, with respect to any officially released
results".[21] Venezuela's Foreign Minister Yván Gil rejected the report as
false and called it part of "a series of lies" and a "far right" plot.[287]

### Tally sheets

Opposition groups stated their intent the day after the election to publish
the detailed electoral results in the form of scanned copies of the tally
sheets (_actas de escrutinio_) and other digital formats[8]: 21 on a website
_resultadospresidencialesvenezuela2024.com_[15][22] where registered voters
can check the results for their place of voting. According to _La Patilla_ ,
Venezuelan authorities blocked access to the server on Venezuelan internet
providers. _La Patilla_ recommended the use of VPNs for accessing the
website.[16] The opposition reported that, on 31 July, more than 44 million
website attacks were prevented, with more than 32 million users consulting the
database in 24 hours.[288]

On 1 August, presidents Gabriel Boric of Chile, Gustavo Petro of Colombia,
Lula da Silva of Brazil, and Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico called for
the CNE to publish its version of the tally sheets and the full vote
counts.[289][290] The following day, the Supreme Tribunal of Justice asked the
CNE to provide the nationwide tally sheets and summed reports within three
calendar days.[291]

### Parallel vote tabulation

In the AltaVista PVT project with a preregistered statistical sampling method
of parallel vote tabulation,[292] a team of statisticians applied their method
by photographing results from 997 polling stations and inferring the national
vote shares. They found 66.1% for González and 31.4% for Maduro, each with an
error margin of 0.5%. The participation rate was estimated as 60.1%.[293][294]

### Turnout and voter changes

According to _The New York Times_ , government officials believed that "a
combination of high turnout among loyalists and suppressing the vote for the
opposition" would assure a win for the incumbent party. But many voters who
traditionally had supported the government had left Venezuela or had "turned
from Mr. Maduro", so that "the financial muscle of an oil state to bring
supporters to the polls" failed to produce the desired result. Efforts by the
Maduro government to revive economic growth by privatizing the economy led to
reduced public spending, including the handouts and social services
traditionally used to mobilize the vote. In previous campaigns, one PSUV
organizer explained, the government "gave out everything from motorbikes to
refrigerators", while in this election campaign, "all she got was boxes of
poor-quality food and house paint".[295]

### Results announced by the National Electoral Council (CNE)

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Elvis_Amoroso.jpg/180px-
Elvis_Amoroso.jpg)Elvis Amoroso, head of CNE, Venezuelan's electoral body

The CNE announced initial results on 29 July.[17] As of 21 August, the CNE had
not released any tally sheets or voter data to support its results.[20][296]
On 29 July, CNE head Elvis Amoroso alleged that CNE had been the victim of a
cyberattack and accused the opposition of orchestrating it;[297] no evidence
was presented.[298][299] On both 31 July and 1 August, the CNE announced that
it would release the second bulletin of the results.[300] On 2 August, the CNE
announced a second bulletin of votes, still in favor of Maduro, but still
without tally sheets or other polling station level details.[301] Jennie
Lincoln, who headed the Carter Center observation of the election, rejected
the results again as not being transparent, and stated that Venezuela was able
to provide individual table tallies as they had done so in past
elections.[302]

Journalists from _The Washington Post_ analyzed the tally sheet scans
published online by the opposition, and looked at "hundreds" of physical paper
tally sheets stored by the opposition in secret locations. The journalists
interviewed several of the people whose signatures appear on the physical
tally sheets, and stated that the physical tally sheets appear to be
authentic. They state that the physical tally sheets match the corresponding
online scans. The journalists analysed 23,720 of the online tally sheets—those
whose QR codes they were successfully able to extract from the images,
constituting 97% of the online total, finding that González won 67% of the
vote and Maduro 30%.[23]

Attorney Juan Carlos Delpino [es], one of the five CNE rectors,[303][304][305]
went into hiding after the election. Delpino stated in an interview with _The
New York Times_ that he had seen no evidence of a Maduro victory, expressing
personal shame that the CNE he had agreed to serve on had "failed the
country". Delpino noted irregularities in the election including the absence
of published vote tallies from the CNE, and a lack of CNE pre-election
meetings that allowed CNE head Amoroso to make "unilateral"
decisions.[306][307]

#### Sequences of zeros in the CNE values

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Decimales_de_los_resultados_del_CNE_de_las_elecciones_presidenciales_de_Venezuela_de_2024.gif/300px-
Decimales_de_los_resultados_del_CNE_de_las_elecciones_presidenciales_de_Venezuela_de_2024.gif)Table
showing percentages provided by the Consejo Nacional Electoral (CNE) to
varying levels of rounding

The CNE's 29 July counts of 5,150,092 votes for Maduro, 4,445,978 votes for
González, and 462,704 other votes and a total of 10,058,774 votes,[17]
released on 29 July 2024, correspond, to a precision of 5 decimal places, to
51.20000%, 44.20000%, and 4.60000%, respectively.[17] In the 2 August CNE
results, the invalid/null vote count is 0.41000% at a precision of 5 decimal
places.[308] These sequences of successive zeros were discussed as a possible
sign of fraud.[309][18][310] Argentine journalist Matías Mowzet noticed that
writing the three values as percentages rounded to five decimal places gave
sequences ending in four zeros for each of the three values. The votes for
Maduro, González and others correspond to the percentages 51.20000%, 44.20000%
and 4.6000%, respectively.[18]

For the vote counts to correspond to percentages that have zeros in the second
to fifth decimal places is an unlikely coincidence,[19][311] with a
probability of around one in a hundred million, as discussed by Kiko Llaneras,
a statistician writing in _El País_ ,[18] mathematician Terence Tao,[310] and
statistician Andrew Gelman.[312] _El Espectador_ interpreted this as likely
fraud.[18] _Infobae_ also stated that improbability raised suspicion about the
29 July CNE statement of the results.[19]

Tao described a Bayesian analysis considering the null hypothesis that the 29
July CNE counts are authentic, and the alternative hypothesis that they are
fraudulent. He found that the probability of the official counts occurring is
"extremely small" in the case of the counts being authentic (the null
hypothesis) and that there is a "plausible causal chain ... that leads to an
elevated probability" of the official counts occurring for the hypothesis of
manipulation (the alternative hypothesis). The causal chain of the
manipulation hypothesis is that a decision was made to manipulate the data,
officials followed orders to report vote counts based on a given rounded
percentage, and other officials raised no objections to the fabricated
counts.[310]

On 2 August, Elvis Amoroso made a new statement, asserting that 96.87% of the
ballots had been counted, accounting for 12,335,884 valid votes and 50,785
null/invalid votes, giving a total of 12,386,669 votes cast,[308][313] which
corresponds to 0.41000% of null/invalid votes at a precision of 5 decimal
places.

### Results announced by the Democratic Unitary Platform (PUD)

Mesas_Gonzalez_to_Maduro_ratio_data_release_version1.svg.png)González-to-
Maduro vote ratio versus registered voters per mesa; the ratios scatter around
one in small voting places and from one to ten in large voting places (PUD
data version 1).[143]

A database which allowed Venezuelans to use their national identity card to
verify vote tallies was released by the PUD on 30 July, which they said
reflected 73% of the votes cast. The database shows scans of the vote tally
sheets, with votes cast for each candidate at each voting place gathered
during the electoral process. As of 21 August,[20] the government has not
released a similar accounting, which the Carter Center said was
needed.[315][139] Opposition groups released a CSV-format file with the
polling-station level data for 24,532 polling stations.[143] At the mesa
(table) level in version 1 of the tally sheets, 86.60% of the mesas had more
votes for González than for Maduro, 0.17% tied exactly, and 13.23% had more
votes for Maduro.[143]

An independent analysis of the count released by PUD was conducted by the
Associated Press and corroborated the opposition results. The Associated Press
stated that it could not independently verify the authenticity of the
published tally sheets.[22] On 3 August 2024, the Colombian civil society
network Electoral Observation Mission (MOE) published its analysis of the PUD
results, finding them fully self-consistent. MOE called for the CNE to publish
the polling station tally sheets and audit the full chain of transmission of
information.[316] MOE stated that González necessarily won the election based
on the publicly available tally sheets analysed by MOE (73.1% of the total),
since the missing sheets were too few to give a majority to Maduro, even if
100% of the votes on the missing tally sheets were for Maduro.[312]

A study from political scientist Dorothy Kronick, described by _The New York
Times_ as "an expert on Venezuelan electoral data at the University of
California, Berkeley",[317] stated that the opposition data "almost certainly
reflects actual votes cast".[20][318]

#### Mebane statistical analysis of opposition vote data

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Elecciones_presidenciales_de_Venezuela_de_2024_-_Resultado_por_parroquias_%28Comando_con_Venezuela%29.svg/220px-

by parish announced by the PUD

A working paper published by Walter Mebane, that used statistical tools for
electoral forensics, found no evidence of incremental or extreme fraud in the
opposition-published results. He found no evidence of incremental or extreme
fraud in the election minutes as published by the opposition. Using these
minutes, he calculated that the probability of no fraud having occurred in the
opposition tallies (π1) at 99.97%. He also calculated that the probability of
incremental fraud having occurred (π2) at 0.0185% and that extreme fraud
having occurred (π3) at 0.0114%.[319][12]

Mebane identified only two polling stations where fraud may have occurred;
however, using a 99.5% credibility interval, it is not possible to state that
this occurred in these two polls. Mebane's paper compared the results of other
elections in Venezuela between 2000 and 2013. The tallies provided by the
opposition in the 2024 elections have the highest probability of no
fraud.[319]

## Reactions

On 30 July, the Carter Center issued a harsh rebuke of the election
authorities,[150][321] stating there was a "complete lack of transparency" and
that the election "cannot be considered democratic".[151]

### Fraud allegations

See also: § Sequences of zeros in the CNE values

Anne Applebaum wrote in _The Atlantic_ that it "was absolutely clear by [31
July] that ... the election had been stolen".[293] Independent observers have
described the election results as arbitrary, even by Venezuelan standards,
according to _The Guardian_.[250]

Political scientist Steven Levitsky called the vote "one of the most egregious
electoral frauds in modern Latin American history."[24]

Political scientist Dalson Figueiredo of the Federal University of Pernambuco,
one of the authors of the AltaVista parallel vote tabulation project, stated:
"After analyzing our own data, seeing the opposition's results and how they
both match up, my conclusion is that we're witnessing the largest electoral
fraud in the history of Latin America."[23]

On his blog, mathematician Terence Tao pointed out that the election results
had "oddly round percentages", suggesting that the election was fixed.[322]

(left) and González (middle) along with his wife (right), addressing the
nation in front of the United Nations Development Programme office in Caracas,
2024

Supporting the PUD/González win announcement, María Corina Machado and Edmundo
González rejected the results from the CNE and claimed victory.[323] On 31
July, Maduro alleged that the US was fomenting civil war in Venezuela.[324]
González, at an event accompanied by Machado, said "The Venezuelans and the
entire world know what happened ... Our struggle continues and we will not
rest until the will of the Venezuelan people is respected".[323]

The Communist Party of Venezuela objected to the CNE announcement and called
for the complete election results to be published.[325]

Supporting the CNE's announcement of his victory, Maduro described the result
as "a triumph of peace and stability".[326] Candidates Benjamín Rausseo,
Daniel Ceballos, Luis Eduardo Martínez and José Brito recognized the official
results;[327] the latter three were nominated by intervened parties.[198]
Although still maintaining that he won, Maduro acknowledged the unrest in
Venezuela. He blamed the turmoil on "international Zionism", referencing an
antisemitic trope that Jews control the world.[328][329]

A Meganálisis poll of 1,007 people in Venezuela from 8 to 11 August found that
93% of respondents believe Maduro lost the election, with the majority of
Venezuelans expressing anger, anxiety, indignation, and feelings of
helplessness after the election. Venezuelans who responded that they were
happy were 2.8%, and the poll found that 40% hoped to leave the country before
the end of 2024.[330]

### International

Main article: International reactions to the 2024 Venezuelan presidential
election

The election results released by the government-controlled National Electoral
Council (CNE) were followed by a mixture of scepticism and criticism from the
leaders of most Latin American countries. Some Latin American
countries—including Cuba, Honduras, and Nicaragua—recognized and congratulated
Maduro as the election winner.[26][25] Some world leaders expressed skepticism
of the claimed results and did not recognize the CNE claims;[25][27][26]
others including Russia, China, Iran and North Korea recognized Nicolás Maduro
as the winner.[27][5]

Edmundo_Gonz%C3%A1lez_recognition_map.svg.png)Map showing the countries that
have declared Edmundo González the winner of the presidential election

President Gabriel Boric of Chile was the first foreign leader to question the
CNE result, stating that the "results are difficult to believe".[331]
President Daniel Noboa of Ecuador warned that "that is the danger of
dictatorship, and today we are witnessing how one more of them tries to take
hope away from millions of Venezuelans."[26] Condemnation from Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Peru and Uruguay described the CNE result in terms of fraud or
corruption.[26][25][331] Harsh criticism came from President Javier Milei of
Argentina, who called Maduro a dictator.[26][332]

The three leftist presidents of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico[293][333][290]
were quick in demanding that all votes be counted, along with full
transparency of all ballot records from each precinct.[334][2][26] The
Colombian government called for the "total vote count, its verification and
independent audit to be carried out as soon as possible".[26] President Luís
Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil called the controversy a "normal" process, but
asked for the release of the total vote tally.[335] President Andrés Manuel
López Obrador of Mexico said on 30 July that the vote tallies should be
publicized, but he saw no evidence of fraud.[336] On 1 August, the three
presidents released a joint statement of concern over post-election violence,
and asking for "impartial verification of results"[290] quickly, at the
disaggregated level.[289] Officials from the three nations—whose governments
are allied with Maduro according to the Associated Press (AP)—worked to seek
"a solution to the country's political crisis".[337] The AP wrote that the
opposition has reason to be wary of recommendations from this group to "follow
Venezuelan laws and appear before the appropriate institutions", since the
"ruling party controls every aspect of government, including the justice
system, and uses it to defeat and repress real and perceived opponents".[337]

United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken initially expressed doubts
about the veracity of the results from the CNE,[26][338] and on 1 August, said
there was "overwhelming evidence" that González won.[339] He called for talks
and a peaceful transition,[324] but did not refer to González as _president-
elect_.[340][a]

The day after the election, nine Latin American countries (Argentina, Costa
Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and
Uruguay[344][345]) called for an emergency meeting of the Organization of
American States (OAS), for 31 July.[346][347] The member states did not reach
consensus on a resolution.[348][349] OAS Secretary General Luis
Almagro—referencing the ongoing investigation in the International Criminal
Court (ICC) of Venezuela for crimes against humanity—said he would petition
the ICC for the arrest of Maduro. Prior to the election, Maduro had stated
that if he did not win, there would be a "bloodbath, a civil war"; Almagro
said Maduro was fulfilling that promise and it was time for justice.[182]

The BBC and _The Guardian_ reported that Peru was the first country to
recognize González as Venezuela's president-elect, on 30 July[350][351]—a
statement from the former Peruvian foreign minister that was clarified on 5
September by Peru's Council of Ministers after a new foreign minister was
named.[352] Peru had recalled its ambassador from Venezuela on 29
July,[26][332] and expelled the Venezuelan diplomats from Peru the next
day.[353][354] In response, Venezuela severed diplomatic relations with
Peru.[350][355] Peruvian President Dina Boluarte reinforced on 6 September
that Peru's position with respect to Venezuela had not changed under the new
foreign minister, saying "We will not be part of an electoral fraud; we will
not support a dictatorial government."[356]

Panama suspended diplomatic relations with Venezuela.[357] Venezuela also
expelled diplomats from Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic,
Panama and Uruguay; as of 1 August, Brazil took over running the Caracas
embassies of Argentina and Peru.[355][358]

## Aftermath: political crisis

Main article: 2024 Venezuelan political crisis

Following the announcements of election results, a national and international
political crisis developed.[359][295][360]

As of 2 September, NGO Foro Penal reported that Venezuela had 1,793 political
prisoners—the highest it has had in the 21st century—of which 1,659, including
children, were detained after the election; most have not been sentenced, but
are charged with terrorism.[361][362]

Protests and crackdown followed the announcement of CNE results

Venezuelan citizens who considered the results to be fraudulent took to the
streets in ongoing protests.[363][364][365] As of 15 August, 25 people had
been killed during protests nationwide.[330] Amnesty International and other
human rights organizations "condemned the repressive actions of the Nicolás
Maduro regime in Venezuela and demanded that it guarantee the right to protest
and full respect for the rights to life, personal integrity and
freedom".[366][367]

### Crackdown

Further information: Operation Tun Tun

Maduro accuses the opposition of promoting a coup.[368] In a crackdown by
security forces following the elections,[369][370][371] he mentioned using
Operation Tun Tun; BBC News stated that "rights groups say it consists of the
authorities going door-to-door to detain those with links to the protests or
the opposition".[368] Maduro ordered two prisons to be rehabilitated to
contain the large number of detainees.[372]

After Diosdado Cabello and Jorge Rodríguez suggested that Machado and González
go to prison,[298][373] Maduro asked authorities to apply "maximum justice"
and accused them of being leaders of violent groups.[374] On 1 August, Machado
published a letter in _The Wall Street Journal_ , stating that she had gone in
to hiding "fearing for my life, my freedom".[375] In a 19 August interview,
Tarek Saab, suggested that opposition leaders could be charged as intellectual
authors of the deaths that occurred in post-electoral violence.[108]

Freddy Superlano, a former candidate, was detained by masked men two days
after the election,[315][370] and held on unknown charges at El Helicoide
along with detained journalist Roland Carreño [es].[376] After the election,
supporters and representatives of the opposition, as well as journalists, have
been detained.[368][377][378][226] Opposition leaders said that citizens who
witnessed the vote tally sheets in the electoral process (poll watchers) were
persecuted and detained.[369]

The press and social media have been subject to censorship.[226][379][380] The
legislature passed a new law "to more tightly regulate non-governmental
organizations, amid criticism of a government crackdown".[381]

### Transparency in vote reporting and Supreme Court ruling

Main article: 2024 Venezuelan political crisis § Transparency in vote
reporting and Supreme Court ruling

Opposition leaders, world leaders and observers urged Maduro to make the vote
tallies at the polling station level public,[33] which had not happened as of
21 August.[20] Refusing to cede power,[28] Maduro instead asked the Supreme
Tribunal of Justice on 1 August to audit and approve the
results.[32][33][34][35]

The BBC stated that the TSJ review is "likely to be conducted behind closed
doors" where only members will see the tallies. The Carter Center,
anticipating this move, stated that "the TSJ is another government
institution, appointed by the government ...  not an independent
assessment".[33] _Efecto Cocuyo_ questioned the independence of the TSJ
observers.[382]

As anticipated,[33][30][31][383] after reviewing materials submitted, the
Supreme Justice Tribunal (TSJ), composed of justices loyal to Maduro,
validated the CNE's statements of a win by Maduro; the opposition and other
observers have characterized their ruling as invalid, stating that the high
court has no constitutional authority over elections.[20][32][35][30] The
court stated that the opposition vote tallies were falsified; the Associated
Press wrote that the Maduro administration "has claimed—without evidence—that
a foreign cyberattack staged by hackers from North Macedonia delayed the vote
counting on election night and publication of the disaggregated results."[35]

NTN24 reported that on 26 August, the CNE webpage was briefly accessible.
During the period of access, some people were able to view the names of
witnesses of the _actas_ and check if they matched what the opposition had
reported on _resultadosporvenezuela.com_. According to NTN24, the names were
found to match.[384]

### González arrest warrant and exile

Caryslia Rodríguez, president of the high court, said that a criminal
investigation would be conducted regarding "presumably false" results that
were published;[32] González was summoned to appear on accusations, among
others, of usurping the CNE's functions by uploading election records to
_www.resultadosconvzla.com_ ;[385] he did not appear for the 26 August
summons,[386][387] or the second summons on 27 August.[388]

After he failed to respond to a third summons, an arrest warrant was issued on
2 September for González for crimes including criminal association and
conspiracy after prosecutor Luis Ernesto Dueñez Reyes "requested Gonzalez be
arrested for usurpation of functions, falsification of public documents,
instigation to disobey the law, conspiracy and association", according to
Reuters.[38][389] González sought refuge for several days in the Spanish
embassy in Caracas, and was granted asylum, leaving on a Spanish Armed Forces
flight for Madrid on 7 September 2024.[39][390][391]

### Transition proposals

Main article: 2024 Venezuelan political crisis § Transition proposals

Negotiated peaceful transition of power proposals include an exit
deal[392][393][394] and power-sharing;[395] repeating the election was also
proposed.[34] But Machado said the opposition was willing to negotiate for
Maduro to recognize González's win, said the electoral victory was non-
negotiable and the opposition would not agree to power-sharing.[394] Both the
opposition and the Maduro government rejected the idea of repeat
elections—both stating they had already won.[396][397] Amnesty proposals have
been advanced and denied.[398][399]
