The **50th general election of the House of Representatives**[2] was held in
Japan on 27 October 2024 due to the early dissolution of the House of
Representatives, the lower house of the National Diet, by Prime Minister
Shigeru Ishiba.[3] Voting took place in all constituencies, including
proportional blocks, to elect all 465 members of the House of Representatives.

The election was held one month after Ishiba took office as prime minister,
after winning a heated contest in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
presidential election on 27 September, following the resignation of Fumio
Kishida as party leader due to his low approval rating amid the party-wide
slush fund corruption scandal. The dissolution of the Diet was held eight days
after the prime minister's inauguration and 26 days before the voting day,
both the shortest since the end of World War II.

Amid continued public discontent with the slush fund scandal, the governing
LDP and its coalition partner Komeito lost their parliamentary majority in the
lower house for the first time since 2009, with the LDP suffering its second-
worst result in its history, securing only 191 seats. The Constitutional
Democratic Party (CDP), the main opposition party led by former Prime Minister
Yoshihiko Noda, achieved its best result in its history, increasing its seat
count from 96 to 148. This was the first general election in Japan since 1955
wherein no party secured at least 200 seats.

The Democratic Party for the People (DPP) won 28 seats, surpassing Komeito to
become the fourth-largest party in the chamber. Komeito suffered further
losses including losing all of its seats in Osaka at the expense of the Osaka-
based Ishin no Kai as well as the party's newly elected leader Keiichi Ishii
losing his seat. Smaller opposition parties also gained seats, including left-
wing populist party Reiwa Shinsengumi, right-wing populist party Sanseitō and
the newly-formed far-right Conservative Party.

## Background

[edit]

### Kishida's resignation amid scandals and unpopularity

Resignation_of_the_Kishida_Cabinet_20241001%2C_1.jpg)Prime Minister Fumio
Kishida resigned on 1 October.

Since the last general election in 2021, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida was
caught in a series of political crises, firstly the assassination of Shinzo
Abe in 2022, which led to the heightened scrutiny against the allegations
surrounding the Unification Church and its link to his Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP). The close relationship between the party and the church caused a
drop in approval rating of the Kishida cabinet,[4][5] and anti-government
protests, leading to the first reshuffle of his cabinet on 10 August 2022 and
second reshuffle in September 2023 to remove cabinet members affiliated with
the church.[6][7]

The Kishida government was further damaged by the party-wide slush fund
corruption scandal in late 2023, which saw his approval rate drop to 23% as of
13 December 2023, the lowest such rating any prime minister had had since the
LDP returned to power in 2012.[8] By 22 December, Kishida's approval rate had
further declined to 17%.[9] On 18 January 2024, Kishida announced his
intention to dissolve his Kōchikai faction as a result of the scandal.[10] The
following day on 19 January, the Shisuikai (Nikai faction) and Seiwa Seisaku
Kenkyūkai (Abe faction) announced their dissolutions.[11]

Kishida never recovered from the record-low approval ratings amid fallout from
the scandal. His party lost all three seats up for election in the April 2024
by-elections, which were previously held by LDP or LDP-affiliated
independents.[12] On 14 August 2024, Kishida announced that he would step down
as party president, thereby not seeking re-election in September.[13]

On 30 September 2024, former Minister of Defense Shigeru Ishiba, who won the
heated nine-way contest in the party presidential election on 27 September,
officially announced that he would call an early election to be held on 27
October, a year ahead of the expiration of the current term, to seek
confidence from the people. After his inauguration as the prime minister on 1
October, the House of Representatives was dissolved on 9 October, with the
election being announced on the 15th, and voting to take place on the
27th.[14]

The election is held after the replacement of major party leaders. The LDP
elected Ishiba as new leader on 27 September, the Constitutional Democratic
Party (CDP) elected former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda on 23 September,
Nobuyuki Baba took leadership of Nippon Ishin no Kai on 30 November 2021,
Keiichi Ishii was elected leader of Komeito on 28 September, and Tomoko Tamura
became leader of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) on 18 January 2024. It is
the first time since 2012 where all three of the leading parties in the Diet
have had new leadership entering the next election.

The regular election to the House of Councillors, the other house of the
national legislature which cannot be dissolved and is thus on fixed terms,
will take place in 2025; but, also on 27 October, a by-election to the House
of Councillors will be held in Iwate. On the prefectural level, the
gubernatorial elections in Toyama and Okayama had already been set for 27
October. This was the first dissolution of the Diet since 14 October 2021. The
dissolution was eight days after the prime minister's inauguration and the
voting and counting 26 days later that, both the shortest since the end of
World War II.[15]

## Electoral system

[edit]

The 465 seats of the House of Representatives are contested via parallel
voting. Of these, 289 members are elected in single-member constituencies
using first-past-the-post voting, while 176 members are elected in 11 multi-
member constituencies via party list proportional representation. Candidates
from parties with legal political party-list, which requires either ≥5 Diet
members or ≥1 Diet member and ≥2% of the nationwide vote in one tier of a
recent national election, are allowed to stand in a constituency and be
present on the party list. If they lose their constituency vote, they may
still be elected in the proportionally allocated seats. However, if such a
dual candidate wins less than 10% of the vote in their majoritarian
constituency, they are also disqualified as a proportional candidate.

### Reapportionment

[edit]

The electoral districts will be readjusted according to the results of the
2020 Japan census. Originally, it was intended to be readjusted for the last
election, but it was held in the existing constituencies not long after the
census results came out.[16][17]

#### Newly created seats

[edit]

Ten new districts and three new block seats will be created.

  1. Tokyo-26th
  2. Tokyo-27th
  3. Tokyo-28th
  4. Tokyo-29th
  5. Tokyo-30th
  6. Kanagawa-19th

  10. Chiba-14th
  11. 18th Tokyo block seat

  2. Miyagi-6th
  3. Niigata-6th
  4. Fukushima-5th

the electoral race also increased from 5.7% in 2021 to 23.4%. There were also
136 candidates who were related to previous officeholders, making up 10% of
all candidates. The LDP accounted for 97 of them, equivalent to 28.4% of all

On 6 October, Shigeru Ishiba indicated that he would not endorse any lawmakers
who have been suspended from party membership over the LDP slush fund scandal.
Ishiba also indicated that those who had involved scandal, whether they had
been sanctioned or not, would be banned from running double candidacy in
single-seat districts and proportional representation blocs, which was
expected to affect at least 30 such candidates.[19] He explained that it was a
response to the "criticism and anger" of the public which were stronger than
they expected.[20]

On 9 October, the LDP officially pulled its endorsement of the following 12
members:[21]

Party membership suspended:

  * Hakubun Shimomura (Tokyo 11th district), former Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology
  * Yasutoshi Nishimura (Hyogo 9th district), former Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry
  * Tsuyoshi Takagi (Fukui 2nd district), former Chairman of the LDP Diet Affairs Committee

Suspended from party positions for one year which still in effect:

  * Kōichi Hagiuda (Tokyo 24th district), former Chairman of the LDP Policy Research Council
  * Katsuei Hirasawa (Tokyo 17th district), former Minister of Reconstruction
  * Hiromi Mitsubayashi (Saitama 14th district), former Vice Minister of the Cabinet Office

Suspended from party positions for six months which now expired:

  * Ichiro Kanke (Tohoku PR block), former Deputy Minister of Reconstruction (withdrew his candidacy on 12 October)[22]
  * Kazuyuki Nakane (Northern Kanto PR block), former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs
  * Kiyoshi Odawara (Tokyo 21st district), former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs

Received disciplinary reprimand:

  * Kenichi Hosoda (Niigata 2nd district), former Deputy Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry

No punishment received:

  * Takao Ochi (Tokyo PR block), former Deputy Minister of Cabinet Office
  * Hirofumi Imamura (Tokyo PR block), former member of the House of Representatives

On 11 October, three members who were involved in the scandal, all from the
former Seiwa Seisaku Kenkyūkai faction, including former Parliamentary Vice-
Minister for Internal Affairs and Communications Mio Sugita, who was suspended
from party positions for six months, former Vice-Minister for Internal Affairs
and Communications Asako Omi, who was given a reprimand, and former
Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs Kentaro Uesugi, who did not
receive any disciplinary action, would withdraw their candidacies in the
election.[23]

Keiichi Ishii, leader of the Komeito which was LDP's junior coalition partner,
said on 8 October that the party would not recommend LDP lawmakers who were
not officially endorsed in the election,[24] but decided to recommend
Nishimura and Mitsubayashi on 9 October despite LDP decision based on the
wishes of the party's local organizations.[25]

After holding talks with the right-leaning Nippon Ishin no Kai leader Nobuyuki
Baba and Democratic Party for the People (DPP) leader Yuichiro Tamaki on 3
October in an attempt to unifying opposition candidates for constituencies to
prevent the LDP and its Komeito ally from securing a majority, CDP leader
Yoshihiko Noda on 4 October switched his stance to aiming to form a government
on its own by filling more candidates in the proportional representation
blocks.[28][29]

The CDP and the left-wing pacifist JCP also had differences over their stances
on the security-related laws, as Noda aimed at winning over "moderate
conservatives" critical of the LDP government, by formulating more middle-of-
the-road foreign policy and security measures including the continuation of
the laws, while the JCP, which was fielding as many as 216 candidates in the
single-seat constituencies, advocated for the repeal of the laws under the
banner of the opposition coalition during the 2016 House of Councillors
election.[30]

_The Nikkei_ on 11 October reported that the opposition could only manage to
have 55 constituencies where they would be an one-on-one battle with the LDP,
under 20% of the 289 single-seat constituencies as compared to the 140
constituencies in the previous election in 2021. There would be 81
constituencies where CDP, Ishin and other parties compete, and 67 where CDP
competes with opposition parties other than Ishin.[31]

On 3 October, Seiji Maehara, leader of the Free Education For All which
commanded four seats in the Diet, announced that his party would join the
Nippon Ishin no Kai after months of talks for merger and would run as Ishin-
endorsed candidates in the upcoming election. However, House of
Representatives member Atsushi Suzuki, who would run in the Kanagawa 18th
district, did not join the party, due to its competition with a Ishin
candidate in the same constituency. On the same day he announced that he would
run as an official candidate for the Sanseitō party.[32] Suzuki later decided
that he would run in the Southern Kanto proportional representation block with
the Sanseitō's endorsement.[33]

## Campaign

[edit]

A week before the election, a Kyodo News survey on 20 October showed that the
support for the CDP and other opposition parties was growing steadily against
that of the ruling LDP, with 22.6% of the respondents planned to vote for the
LDP in the proportional representation block, 14.1% for the CDP, narrowing the
gap between the two main parties to 8.5 percentage points from 14.0 points in
the last survey. 9.7% of respondents wanted to see the ruling and opposition
parties to be evenly split, while 20.5% said they wanted to see the LDP out of
power, up 5.4 points from the previous survey.[34]

Another poll on 21 October by the Kyodo News suggested the LDP-Komeito
coalition might lose its majority, the first time since the 2009 general
election, while the CDP could win more than 100 seats in the single-seat
districts, up sharply from 60 before the election, and more seats under
proportional representation. The Nippon Ishin no Kai was projected to lose
some of its 43 seats, while the DPP could increase its seats from seven before
the race due to greater support in the proportional representation block, with
the JCP building on the nine seats it held.[35]

On 20 October, LDP Secretary-General Hiroshi Moriyama floated the idea of
expanding the coalition framework by "holding discussions with political
parties that have the same policies and are committed to developing the
country". Although he said that he did not have a specific party in mind,
there were "whispers" within the party that the conservative-leaning Ishin and
DPP could be new coalition partners.[36] Ishin Secretary-General Fujita
Fumitake on 23 October said it was impossible for the time being for his party
to form a coalition with the LDP and Komeito if the ruling coalition lost its
majority.[37] He also declined to form a coalition with the CDP given that the
LDP and Komeito Party did not have a majority, citing differences in their
security, energy, and economic policies.[38]

As the possibility of LDP losing power became likely, Prime Minister Shigeru
Ishiba began to question the CDP's ability to govern, reminding voters the
"nightmare Democratic Party administration",[39] CDP's predecessor which ruled
from 2009 to 2012, while CDP leader Yoshihiko Noda, who was also then the
Democratic prime minister, stepped up his criticism of the LDP slush fund
scandal and called for a change of government.[40] Going into the last week of
the campaign, each party began to narrow down the electoral districts which
were fiercely contested, with their party leaders and executives rallying
their support in those districts.[41] The LDP designated about 40 single-seat
constituencies with close races as key constituencies.[42] Ishin aimed to
retain their stronghold of Osaka, where it faced off against Komeito,[43]
while also hoping to expand its support outside of Kansai. The JCP and SDP
hoped to maintain its Okinawa electoral district seats and expanded their
proportional representation votes.[41]

On 23 October, the JCP's daily newspaper _Shimbun Akahata_ accused the LDP of
providing funds to the party's local branches headed by scandal-hit candidates
which were not endorsed by the party, with 20 million yen ($130,000) to each
chapter.[44] Ishiba insisted that the funds were not provided to candidates
but to the branches as "activity expenses", with the party dismissing the
report as having "distorted the facts and caused a misunderstanding".[45] CDP
leader Noda criticised the LDP for "deceiving voters" and that it "should
never be done".[46] Koichi Hagiuda, whose branch received the "activity
expenses", announced on 25 October that he had repaid the 20 million yen.[47]

## Election violence

[edit]

On the morning of 19 October, Atsunobu Usuda, a 49-year-old man from Kawaguchi
in Saitama Prefecture, threw firebombs at the LDP headquarters and crashed a
van into a barrier at the nearby Prime Minister's Office in Tokyo. No injury
was reported but a police vehicle was partially burned after Usuda threw
around five objects at the LDP headquarters. According to his father, Usuda
had previously been active in anti-nuclear protests and had also expressed
dissatisfaction with Japan's electoral system, where candidates are required
to deposit hefty sums of money to stand.[48]

Speaking during a campaign in Satsumasendai, Kagoshima Prefecture on the same
day, Prime Minister Ishiba said that "democracy must never succumb to
violence" and pledged to do "everything possible to ensure that this election
is not ruined by violence".[49]

## Debates

[edit]

The LDP slush fund scandal became a major issue during the debate hosted by
the Japan National Press Club on 12 October. CDP leader Yoshihiko Noda
criticised Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's dissolution of the Diet as a
"cover-up" of the scandal and that "a change of government is the greatest
political reform". Ishiba said that he would consider abolishing the policy
activity expenses in the future but maintained that "it is legal under the
current system" and the party would not use it "restrainedly" when questioned
by DPP leader, Yuichiro Tamaki.[50] Ishin leader Nobuyuki Baba also criticised
Komeito's decision to recommend two former LDP lawmakers which were not
endorsed by the LDP due to the scandal. Komeito leader, Ishii Keiichi
explained that the decision was based on criteria such as "the understanding
of local [Komeito] party members and supporters".[51]

Several opposition parties called for the reduction or abolition of the
consumption tax, with the CDP suggesting a "tax credit with benefits" that
would essentially refund part of the consumption tax by combining tax credits
and benefits for low- and middle-income earners. Ishiba argued that the
country needed a stable source of funding for social security going forward
and would not consider lowering the tax.[52]

Noda suggested that Japan should participate as an observer in the Conference
of the Parties to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in order to
achieve nuclear abolition, while Ishiba stressed the functionality of nuclear
deterrence.[51] Noda also said he would abolish the unconstitutional parts of
the security-related laws if the CDP gained power.[53] Baba questioned
Ishiba's determination and feasibility in reviewing the U.S.–Japan Status of
Forces Agreement, a pledge made during the recent LDP leadership race.[51]

of single-member constituencies and proportional blocs

Voter turnout was 53.84%, around two percentage points down from 2021 and the
third lowest in the postwar era,[57] while the number of female candidates
reached the record high of 73,[58] equivalent to 16% of the House of
Representatives' composition.[59]

The ruling LDP-Komeito coalition lost their majority for the first time since
2009. Although the LDP still remained the largest party, the coalition fell
short of the 233 seats needed for a majority, securing only 215.[60] Prime
Minister Shigeru Ishiba said he accepted the "harsh judgement" of the voters
"humbly and solemnly" and pledged to become a political party that was "more
in line with the will of the people".[61]

74% of voters in a Kyodo News exit poll considered the slush fund scandal when
casting their ballots, with 68% of the LDP supporters also thought so.[62]
Komeito leader Keiichi Ishii also pointed out that the payment of 20 million
yen to party branches headed by the scandal-hit candidates "had a significant
impact on the election campaign".[63] At least two LDP cabinet members lost in
the election, Minister of Justice Hideki Makihara and Minister of Agriculture,
Forestry and Fisheries Yasuhiro Ozato, who lost in the Saitama 5th district,
to former CDP leader Yukio Edano, and Kagoshima 3rd district respectively.[64]

Seven out of nine former Abe faction members, including former Minister of
Education Hakubun Shimomura,[60] who were involved in the slush fund scandal
and ran as independents, lost in the election, except for Yasutoshi Nishimura
and Koichi Hagiuda. Excluding these two men, the former Abe faction (Seiwa
Seisaku Kenkyūkai) had 20 winners, compared to the 59 members in last year.
The Aso faction (Shikōkai), chaired by top advisor Taro Aso, became the
largest faction within the party with 31 members. In the former Ishiba faction
(Suigetsukai), centered around Prime Minister Ishiba, members such as Deputy
Minister of Justice Hiroaki Kadoyama and Deputy Minister of the Environment
Tetsuya Yagi were defeated.[65]

Komeito leader Keiichi Ishii — who took the post only a month prior to the
election — lost his Saitama 14th district seat, becoming the first head of the
coalition partner to suffer a defeat since former Komeito leader Akihiro Ota's
loss in 2009.[60] Komeito were also defeated by Ishin candidates in all
electoral districts in Osaka, including the 3rd district, where Deputy Leader
Sato Shigeki lost his seat.[66]

The CDP became the biggest winner in the election, gaining 52 seats and
jumping from 96 seats in the previous election to 148 seats, with leader
Yoshihiko Noda aiming to form a government replacing the LDP with other
opposition parties.[67] The DPP quadrupled its seats from seven to 28 but lost
one proportional representation seat in the Northern Kanto block and two in
the Tokai block because several candidates on the list were elected in the
single-seat constituencies.[68]

Nippon Ishin no Kai, also known as the Japan Restoration Party, faced fierce
challenges outside its Kansai stronghold which saw its losing about three
million votes from the previous election nationally but was able to win all 19
single-seat constituencies in Osaka, ensuring the party's monopoly in the
prefecture.[69] Reiwa Shinsengumi and its party leader Taro Yamamoto tripled
their seats, gaining six from the three they held previously. Yamamoto stated
that he wished to gain more in the future.[61] Reiwa also managed to pass the
JCP for the first time, which fell to eight seats for the first time since
2009 and failed to make gains on the proportional blocks across the country.
JCP leader Tomoko Tamura commented by saying that "despite losses, we were
able to bring the 20 million yen to everyone's attention by running candidates
in every district."[61]

Despite falling short of its goal of winning five seats, the newly established
Conservative Party of Japan gained three seats and entered the Diet for the
first time, with former Nagoya mayor Takashi Kawamura being declared the
winner in the Aichi 1st district and two other candidates won the Tokai
proportional representation block and Kinki proportional representation
block.[70] By receiving more than 2% of the votes in the proportional
representation blocks, the party was officially recognised as a political
party by law and would be given political party subsidies and would be able to
fill duplicate candidates to run in both single-seat constituency and
proportional representation blocks and appear in political broadcasts.[71]

## Aftermath

[edit]

After the election, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed his desire to
continue in his position, saying at a press conference that he would "fulfill
his responsibilities by tackling the current severe challenges".[73] At a
press conference on 28 October, Ishiba also said that it was "essential that
people realize that the LDP has visibly changed" and announced the abolition
of policy activity expenses.[74] LDP's election campaign committee chairman
Shinjiro Koizumi resigned from his position on 28 October to take
responsibility for the party's disastrous performance.[75] Hideki Makihara,
the incumbent Minister of Justice who lost in Saitama 5th district and failed
to be reinstated through proportional representation, indicated his intention
to step down as minister.[76]

Despite Ishiba's decision to remain as party leader, LDP Councillors Kimi
Onoda and Hiroshi Yamada and former Minister of State for Economic Security
Takayuki Kobayashi, all considered close to former Minister of State for
Economic Security Sanae Takaichi who was the main rival to Ishiba in the
leadership election a month prior, called on the party executives to bear
responsibilities.[74] Major newspapers _Sankei Shimbun_ , _Yomiuri Shimbun_ ,
and _Asahi Shimbun_ all ran editorials in their morning editions calling for
Ishiba to step down as prime minister, while _Mainichi Shimbun_ raised
questions about the feasibility of Ishiba's enthusiasm for reform.[77] A Kyodo
News survey also showed on 29 October that the approval rating for the Ishiba
Cabinet fell from 50.7% before the election to 32.1% after the vote, although
only 28.6% said Ishiba should resign, as compared to 65.7% of the respondents
that felt it was unnecessary.[78]

At the party's central executive meeting on 31 October, Komeito leader Keiichi
Ishii, who lost his parliamentary seat only a month after he became party
leader,[79] announced his resignation, after saying that "there will be many
difficulties in continuing as leader" after losing his seat.[73]

Ishin, which saw its proportional representation vote count fall by about
three million from the previous election, also faced an outpouring of
criticism from local assembly members in its home base of Osaka, who blamed
the party's initial decision to align itself with the LDP on amending the
Political Funds Control Law for the "nationwide headwinds".[80] The
prefectural assembly group of the Osaka Restoration Association, the regional
party of Ishin, called on the party executives to bear responsibility for the
worse-than-expected results in the proportional votes and nationally and hold
a party leadership election.[81]

## Government formation

[edit]

After the election result showed the LDP-Komeito coalition falling short of a
majority by 18 seats, Ishiba confirmed with Komeito leader Keiichi Ishii at a
meeting on 28 October that their coalition would continue. While he had ruled
out the possibility of forming a coalition with the opposition parties,[82]
Ishiba expressed his intention to gain support from Ishin and the DPP through
a "partial coalition", i.e. case-by-case support for individual bills.[83] On
30 October, the LDP also brought back to its parliamentary group four members
whom it had de-selected due to the fundraising scandal: Hiroshige Seko,
Katsuei Hirasawa, Yasutoshi Nishimura and Kōichi Hagiuda, who ran as
independents and won.[84][85] Additionally, the party invited two independents
who ran against and defeated LDP-endorsed candidates, Satoshi Mitazono and Ken
Hirose, to join the group. This brought the LDP-Komeito coalition to 221
seats, 12 short of a majority.[86][87]

CDP leader Yoshihiko Noda, the largest winner in the election, said he wanted
to prioritize cooperation with Ishin, DPP and JCP, all of which submitted a
motion of no confidence against the Ishiba Cabinet in the recent extraordinary
Diet session,[73][88] and held talks with Ishin leader Nobuyuki Baba and JCP
leader Tomoko Tamura on 30 October.[84] Mizuho Fukushima, leader of the SDP,
which won one seat, signalled a "strong possibility" to vote for Noda in the
prime ministerial election, which the party had done in an extraordinary Diet
session a month prior.[89]

Both the DPP and the Ishin had ruled out joining an LDP-Komeito
government.[90] Ishin Secretary-General Fujita Fumitake expressed his
disapproval of joining the LDP-Komeito coalition government or cooperating
with the CDP, but stated his intention to hold discussions with each party on
a policy-by-policy basis.[89] DPP leader Yuichiro Tamaki said the party would
not rule out ad hoc cooperation on certain issues, but would not join the
ruling coalition.[91][92] The party agreed at its executive meeting on 30
October to vote for leader Yuichiro Tamaki, even in the event of a run-off
election.[93] In a run-off, all votes not for the top two candidates, Ishiba
and Noda, would be deemed invalid. which would benefit Ishiba.[94] Ishin and
DPP's proposals which could lead to 70 invalid votes in the run-off, were
criticised by CDP Secretary-General Junya Ogawa, who said that the exercise of
the right to nominate prime minister was the "heaviest task" of a Diet
member.[95]

During the meeting between the LDP and DPP on 31 October, the DPP requested
the review of the 1.03-million-yen annual income barrier and basic income tax
deductions, in exchange of its support of the LDP government in passing the
budget proposal and bills,[96] while the CDP and DPP at a meeting on 5
November agreed to aim to revise the Political Funds Control Act again by the
end of the year in order to speed up political reform.[97]
