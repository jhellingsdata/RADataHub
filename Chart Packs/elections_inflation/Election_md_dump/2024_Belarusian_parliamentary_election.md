Parliamentary elections were held in Belarus on 25 February 2024.[1][2][3] The
country elected 110 deputies to the lower house of parliament (House of
Representatives) and about 12,000 representatives of local councils.[4]

There were no opposition candidates in these parliamentary campaigns — all
contenders come from four registered political parties, each of which is pro-
government, or pro-government independents.[5] The Belarusian opposition
called for boycotting the elections or voting against all.[6][7] The
Belarusian authorities refused to invite observers from the OSCE.[8]

## Background

[edit]

The elections were the first since the 2020–2021 Belarusian protests against
the authoritarian regime of President Alexander Lukashenko, who has been in
office since 1994. Lukashenko warned that the authorities had "learnt our
lesson" since the protests and that there would be "no rebellions" during the
election. A month before the election, the Belarusian KGB launched a series of
raids targeting the families of political prisoners.[9] Observers and human
rights organizations have noted that since the protests, the regime has
thoroughly "cleansed" the political landscape, and that conditions for free
elections are "currently practically absent in Belarus."[10]

On 29 January 2024, at the meeting of the Supreme State Council of the Union
State of Russia and Belarus, Lukashenko expressed confidence that the voting
will be held calmly. "The period is so difficult, but, as you can see, it
passes calmly. And I'm sure we'll approach these dates calmly and hold these
events just as calmly."[5] Days before the election, Lukashenko accused the
West of trying to use "new triggers to destabilize the society" and claimed
that Polish authorities were trying to convince senior Belarusian officials to
switch their allegiance as part of a coup plot. Belarusian political analyst
Valery Karbalevich noted that Lukashenko was treating the election like a
"military operation", with authorities seeing any vote "as a threat and a
pretext to step up repressions and tighten the screws."[11]

## Electoral system and conduct

[edit]

The 110 members of the House of Representatives were elected from single-
member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting.[12]

On 16 February 2023, the Law "On Amendments to the Electoral Code of the
Republic of Belarus" was adopted. According to the law, the minimum voter
turnout threshold was abolished and a ban on photographing the ballot paper
was introduced. In addition, polling stations for voting abroad were abolished
and additional requirements for parliamentary candidates were introduced
(including a ban on dual citizenship).[13] The Interior Ministry conducted
drills during which police detained offenders photographing ballots and
creating artificial queues outside polling stations.[14]

Early voting was held from 20 to 24 February 2024 with turnout reaching over
40% according to authorities. The Viasna Human Rights Center said that
students, soldiers, teachers and other government employees were forced to
participate in early voting.[14] Authorities later said that total turnout
reached 73%.[15]

## Participating parties

[edit]

In February 2023, the Belarusian government changed the legislation on
political parties. The minimum number of members was increased from one to
five thousand, the obligation to have structures in all country regions and
other tightening norms were introduced.[16] In Summer-Autumn 2023, the
Belarusian authorities conducted a mass "re-registration" of political
parties, as a result of which only 4 out of 15 parties remained registered. 11
other parties - mostly opposition parties - were legally liquidated at the
request of the Ministry of Justice of Belarus.[17] The initiator of the party
changes was President Lukashenko, who in April 2022 announced about "the
upcoming big work in party building and bringing order in public associations"
and demanded to rewrite the legislation.[18] And in December he said that
"only those parties should work in the political field of the country, the
activity of which corresponds to the basic principles of domestic and foreign
policy".[19] The political parties that were allowed to run in the elections
have supported Lukashenko's policies.[9]

## Observers

[edit]

Since 1995, no election in Belarus has been recognized as free and fair by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).[14] For the 2024
election, its observers were not allowed to participate in the election,
marking the third consecutive time that the organization was prevented from
doing so in Belarus. The Belarusian Foreign Ministry said that the "reasons
for this are clear and simple," namely "the traditional dominance of
representatives of Western countries in OSCE missions," the imposition of
"unjustified and tough" sanctions by Western countries and the "deterioration
of logistical opportunities" in the movement of its citizens to and from the
country. The Central Election Commission of Belarus instead issued invitations
to election commissions in other members of the Commonwealth of Independent
States and delegates from the Association of World Election Bodies. It also
accredited representatives from 23 European Union member states, including
from Germany, Poland and Lithuania, whose identities and affiliations were not
disclosed. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Collective Security Treaty
Organization also sent a mission to observe the vote.[10]

## Reactions

[edit]

On election day Lukashenko announced that he would run again for president in
the 2025 elections.[14]

Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Lukashenko's exiled opponent in the 2020 Belarusian
presidential election, called for a boycott of the election, saying that
"there are no people on the ballot who would offer real changes because the
regime only has allowed puppets convenient for it to take part". She also
called on the international community not to recognize the results of the
election.[9] Tsikhanouskaya's video message was broadcast on 2,000 screens
used for street advertising across Belarus after opposition activists managed
to gain access to them, leading to the arrests of some employees of the firm
which owned the screens.[15] Members of the Belarusian opposition have
popularly referred to the elections as _biazvybary_ (Belarusian: Бязвыбары,
lit. 'without-elections'), in reference to the tight government control over
elections.[25][26][27]

Russian president Vladimir Putin congratulated Lukashenko on "the confident
victory of patriotic forces of Belarus", which he said helped to "ensure
internal political stability."[15]

The United States Department of State condemned the elections, describing them
as being "held in a climate of fear under which no electoral processes could
be called democratic."[28]
