General elections, originally scheduled to be held in 2023,[4] were held in
Pakistan on 8 February 2024 to elect the members of the 16th National
Assembly. The Election Commission of Pakistan announced the detailed schedule
on 15 December 2023.[5]

The elections were held following two years of political unrest after Prime
Minister Imran Khan of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was removed from
office by a no-confidence motion. Subsequently, Khan was arrested and
convicted for corruption and barred from politics for five years. In the run-
up to the elections, a Supreme Court ruling stripped the PTI of their
electoral symbol for failing to hold intra-party elections for
years.[6][7][8][9]

On election night, television broadcasts showed PTI-backed independent
candidates leading in at least 127 national assembly seats, which hinted at a
potential majority. However, the announcement of final results was abruptly
halted.[10] Subsequently, independent candidates ended up winning 103 general
seats including 93 backed by the PTI, followed by 75 from the Pakistan Muslim
League (N) (PML-N) and 54 from the Pakistan People's Party (PPP). In Punjab
and Sindh provinces, the PML-N and the PPP respectively emerged as the largest
parties. Independent candidates backed by the PTI won the most number of seats
in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa while Balochistan voted for the PPP and the PML-N as the
largest parties. Later all parties except the PTI were given reserved seats
for women and minorities.

The Military Establishment was accused of rigging in favour of the PML-N's
leader Nawaz Sharif to keep the PTI's leader Imran Khan out of the electoral
race.[11][12][13][14][15] Observer groups and members of the international
community, including the United States, United Kingdom and the European Union,
have voiced their concerns about the fairness of the elections,[16][17] while
media outlets around the world denounced the election as "fraudulent".[18]

PTI chair Gohar Ali Khan alleged election rigging and claimed that the party
had won 180 National Assembly seats as per provisional election results.[19]
PTI-backed independent candidates did not secure a majority, but they managed
to win more seats than any other single party.[20] Imran Khan also cited
alleged election rigging, and declined to forge alliances with other parties
to establish a coalition government and instead opted to assume an opposition
role in parliament.[21]

At a press conference on 13 February 2024, it was announced by the leaders of
the PML-N and the PPP that they would form a coalition government with the
PML-N's Shehbaz Sharif as prime minister.[22] The Muttahida Qaumi Movement –
Pakistan (MQM-P), the Pakistan Muslim League (Q) (PML-Q), the Istehkam-e-
Pakistan Party (IPP) and the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) also expressed
their intent to join the governmental coalition.[23] On 3 March, Shehbaz
Sharif was re-elected as Prime Minister of Pakistan for the second time,
securing 201 votes against the 92 votes received by the PTI-backed Omar Ayub
Khan. With no party securing a majority in the assembly, Shehbaz became prime
minister with support from the PML-N's allies, including the PPP, MQM-P,
PML-Q, BAP, IPP and other smaller parties.[24]

## Background

### 2018 elections

Further information: 2018 Pakistani general election

General elections were held in Pakistan on 25 July 2018 after the completion
of a five-year term by the outgoing government. At the national level,
elections were held in 272 constituencies, each electing one member to the
National Assembly. At the provincial level, elections were held in each of the
four provinces to elect Members of the Provincial Assemblies (MPA).[25]

As a result of the elections, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) became the
single largest party at the national level in terms of both popular vote and
seats. At the provincial level, the PTI remained the largest party in Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa (KP); the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) remained the largest party
in Sindh and the newly-formed Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) became the largest
party in Balochistan. In Punjab, a hung parliament prevailed with Pakistan
Muslim League (N) (PML-N) emerging as the largest party in terms of directly
elected seats by a narrow margin.[26] However, following the support of the
Pakistan Muslim League (Q) and the joining of independent MPAs into the PTI,
the latter became the largest party and was able to form the government.[27]

### 2022 constitutional crisis

Main articles: 2022 Pakistani constitutional crisis, No-confidence motion
against Imran Khan, and Lettergate

On 8 March 2022, the opposition parties, under the banner of the Pakistan
Democratic Movement (PDM), submitted a motion of no confidence against Prime
Minister Imran Khan to the National Assembly's secretariat.[28][29] On 27
March 2022, Khan waved a diplomatic cypher from US in the public,[30] claiming
that it demanded the removal of Khan's government in a coup.[31] Later he
changed his stance about the US conspiracy against his government, in an
effort to mend ties with the country.[32][33] However, in August 2023, _The
Intercept_ claimed to have published the contents of the diplomatic cable
which had American diplomat Donald Lu on record as stating that "all will be
forgiven" concerning the country's neutrality in the Russian invasion of
Ukraine, if the no-confidence motion against Khan were to succeed.[34] After
the election, JUI-F president Fazal-ur-Rehman, a critic of Imran Khan, claimed
that the motion of no-confidence to remove Khan was introduced on the
instructions of former army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa.[35][36]

On 1 April 2022, Prime Minister Khan announced that in the context of the no-
confidence motion against him in the National Assembly, the three options were
discussed with "establishment" to choose from viz: "resignation, no-confidence
[vote] or elections".[37] On 3 April 2022, President Arif Alvi dissolved the
National Assembly of Pakistan on Khan's advice after the Deputy Speaker of the
National Assembly rejected and set-aside the motion of no confidence; this
move would have required elections to the National Assembly to be held within
90 days.[38][39] On 10 April, after a Supreme Court ruling that the no-
confidence motion was illegally rejected, a no-confidence vote was conducted
and he was ousted from office,[40][41] becoming the first prime minister in
Pakistan to be removed from office by a vote of no confidence.[42][43][44]
Khan claimed the United States was behind his removal because he conducted an
independent foreign policy and had friendly relations with China and Russia.
His removal led to protests from his supporters across Pakistan.[45][46][47]

### PDM government

After the success of the no-confidence motion, on 11 April 2022, Shehbaz
Sharif became the Prime Minister after receiving 174 votes out of a total of
342, two more than the required majority with the support of the Pakistan
People's Party, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam and various smaller parties under the
coalition of the PDM. Dissident members of PTI also supported his candidature.
Meanwhile, the remaining PTI members, who were now in the opposition,
boycotted the session terming it a continuation of a "foreign conspiracy".[48]
A day later, over 100 PTI members tendered resignations from their National
Assembly seats.[49]

The PDM government remained in power until 10 August 2023. Sharif's tenure was
marked by historically high inflation, contraction of the national economy,
and a record devaluation of the Pakistani rupee.[50][51][52]

### Assassination attempt on Imran Khan and his subsequent arrest

Main articles: Attempted assassination of Imran Khan, 2023 Zaman Park raid,
Arrest of Imran Khan, and May 9 riots

Following its ouster from the government, PTI continued to enjoy mass
popularity with its supporters taking to the streets across the country.[53]
In July 2022, during a provincial by-election in Punjab, the party had a
landslide victory after winning 15 of the 20 seats. During October 2022 by-
elections conducted for the National Assembly, the party won 7 out of 9 seats
with Khan winning 6 of the 7 seats he was contesting for.[54] Later in the
year, Khan himself led a well-attended march of protest throughout the
populous province of Punjab, to force an early general election.[55] However,
on 3 November 2022, while he was leading the march through Wazirabad, he was
shot at and injured in an attempted assassination.[56]

As Khan was recovering from the gunshot wounds to his leg, the government
registered several cases against him and attempted to arrest him from his home
in Zaman Park on two different occasions during March 2023. Each time the
police were unable to arrest him as his supporters intervened.[57] Then on 9
May 2023, he was violently arrested by paramilitary forces while marking his
attendance at Islamabad High Court in a corruption case. The arrest came a day
after the country's army warned him for accusing a high-ranking member of the
ISI, Major General Faisal Naseer, of being responsible for the assassination
attempt in November 2022.[58] Nationwide violence followed, in what were
termed as the May 9 riots, with some demonstrators targeting military
installations.[59] Following the events, a crackdown was initiated against the
party by the country's military establishment. PTI leaders, party workers, and
supporters, as well as those perceived to be allied to the party's cause
within the media and legal profession, were targeted.[60][61] Trials of
civilians within military courts were also initiated.[62] Several core leaders
of the party have been in hiding since, with many incarcerated or forced to
abandon the party.[60] Subsequently, two pro-establishment splinter groups
emerged from within the PTI, namely the PTI Parliamentarians (PTI-P), led by
Pervez Khattak, and the Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP), led by Jahangir
Tareen.[63][64]

On 16 February 2024, former Secretary of Defense Naeem Khalid Lodhi claimed
that the military establishment had indirectly contacted Imran Khan in which
Khan was reportedly asked to admit responsibility and apologize for planning
the May 9 riots and assure that such actions would not be repeated in the
future. However, according to Lodhi, no resolution came from these
interactions.[65]

### Schedule controversies

In January 2023, in a bid to force early general elections, the PTI
prematurely dissolved the provincial assemblies it was in power in – namely
Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. According to the constitution of Pakistan,
after the dissolution of an assembly, elections are supposed to be held there
within 90 days, thus, constitutionally limiting the date for the two
provincial elections to be no later than April 2023.[66][67] However, the
Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) delayed the elections to October 2023,
citing lack of funds provided by the PDM government and the unavailability of
the required security personnel.[68][69] The PTI approached the Supreme Court
of Pakistan against the electoral body's decision, terming it a violation of
the constitution, and with a majority verdict the court declared the ECP's
earlier ruling as unconstitutional and ordered it to hold elections by 14 May
2023.[70] After the nationwide May 9 riots that broke out following Imran
Khan's arrest – the election date passed without the Supreme Court order being
enforced. On 30 May, after the passage of a new law, the PDM government filed
a review petition against the court's earlier ruling.[71]

On 10 August 2023, the National Assembly was prematurely dissolved by the
President Arif Alvi on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. This meant
that the election must be held no later than 8 November 2023.[72][73] However,
on 5 August 2023, the results of the 2023 digital census were approved by the
Council of Common Interests headed by Shehbaz Sharif.[74] Therefore, elections
were to be delayed to February 2024 at the latest, as announced by the ECP in
order to carry out fresh electoral delimitations in light of the approved
census results.[75][76] Despite that, on 13 September 2023, President Alvi
proposed 6 November 2023 as a date to the ECP and advised it to seek guidance
from the Supreme Court for the announcement of the election date.[77] On 2
November 2023, the ECP and the President agreed on 8 February 2024 as the date
for the general election.[78][79]

### Return of Nawaz Sharif to electoral politics

At the start of May 2023, the PDM government adopted a law allowing for filing
review petitions against prior Supreme Court verdicts.to[80] At the end of
June, another law, limiting disqualification to five years, was adopted. It
also allows the electoral commission to announce the date of an election
without consulting the President of the country.[81]

After serving 12 months of his 7-year sentence on corruption charges, former
prime minister Nawaz Sharif left the country on 19 November 2019 to receive
medical treatment in London, promising to return in 4 weeks.[82] He was
declared a fugitive in 2021 after failing to appear before courts despite
summons.[83] Sharif obtained protective bail on 19 October 2023, which allowed
him to return from 4 years of self-imposed exile without being arrested.[84]
On October 21, he returned to the country where he was welcomed in Lahore by a
gathering of tens of thousands of his supporters.[85]

On 9 January 2024, a seven-member Supreme Court bench under Chief Justice Qazi
Faez Isa, hearing a review petition against lifetime disqualification,
announced a 6–1 majority verdict with Justice Yahya Afridi dissenting. The
verdict set aside the earlier Supreme Court interpretation of lifetime
disqualification for article 62(1)(f) of the constitution, stating that it
violated fundamental rights, and instead set a five-year disqualification
following the newly passed laws for lawmakers who fail the moral standard of
_"sadiq and ameen"_ (honest and righteous).[86] The timing of the verdict
ensured that Sharif, who was disqualified for life in the _Panama Papers case_
in 2017, is eligible to contest these elections with a possible fourth term as
prime minister.[87]

## Campaign

### PTI de facto ban through intra-party election verdict

Main article: PTI intra-party elections case

On 22 December 2023, the ECP decided against allowing the PTI to keep its
electoral symbol, asserting that the party had failed to conduct intra-party
elections to the commission's satisfaction. Subsequently, on the same day, the
PTI appealed to the Peshawar High Court (PHC) challenging the ECP's decision.
Consequently, a single-member bench suspended the ECP's order until 9 January
2024. On 30 December 2023, the ECP submitted a review application to the PHC.
In the following days, a two-member bench lifted the suspension order while
hearing the case. However, on 10 January 2024, the two-member bench deemed the
ECP's order "illegal, without any lawful authority, and of no legal effect."
Responding to this, on 11 January, the ECP contested the ruling in the Supreme
Court.[88]

On 13 January, a three-member panel of the Supreme Court, headed by Chief
Justice Qazi Faez Isa, sided with the ECP, reinstating their initial decision
to deny the PTI its election symbol, the cricket bat, due to the party's
failure to conduct intra-party elections by its constitution. Consequently,
the PTI was unable to allocate party tickets to any of its candidates,
resulting in all party candidates being listed as independent candidates with
individual electoral symbols.[89] The party also lost the right to nominate
candidates for 226 reserved seats across the central and provincial
legislatures.[90] Removing the cricket bat symbol was viewed as preventing
voters from recognising the party on ballot papers—a crucial factor in
Pakistan where 40 per cent of the population is illiterate.[91]

The Supreme Court's decision led some legal experts to describe the ruling as
a "huge blow to fundamental rights" and "a defeat for democratic norms."[92]

### Imran Khan's convictions

In the week before the elections, Imran Khan was sentenced to jail terms in
three separate cases. On 30 January 2024, with the government seeking a death
penalty, he was sentenced to 10 years in a case dealing with the handling of
state secrets by Judge Abul Hasnat Zulqarnain.[93] A day later, Judge Muhammad
Bashir, sentenced him and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to a jail term of 14 years,
along with a fine of Rs. 787 million (US$2.7 million) each for retaining a
jewellery set that was a state gift from Saudi Arabia against an undervalued
assessment from the country's _Toshakhana_. The ruling also barred Khan from
holding public office for 10 years.[94] Two days later, Judge Qudratullah
declared the marriage of Khan and his wife against Islamic law and sentenced
both to prison for a term of seven years for allegedly solemnising their
marriage during Bushra's _Iddah_ period. The case was lodged on the complaint
of Khawar Maneka, Bushra's former husband, five years after her marriage to
Khan.[95]

All three trials were held behind closed doors in Adiala Jail, where Khan has
been incarcerated since August 2023 on corruption charges, and were marked
with rushed proceedings, sudden replacement of defendant's lawyers with state
consuls, and other procedural irregularities that led his party to term the
decisions to be coming from "kangaroo courts".[96][97][98] Khan's sentencing
in the marriage case was decried by lawyers and members of the civil society
as an overreach and a blow to women's rights.[99][100][101] Meanwhile, some
observers termed the sentencings as a continuation of the Pakistani military's
engineering to keep Khan out of power in the upcoming
elections.[102][103][104] On election day, a PTI official said Khan had been
allowed to vote in prison using a postal ballot.[105]

### Allegations of pre-poll rigging

Some observers, including the United Nations and Human Rights Watch, have
pointed to what appears to be pre-poll rigging in the run-up to the upcoming
elections. There have been notable actions against the PTI and its leaders,
including snatching of nomination papers, arbitrary arrests of candidates and
their supporters, systematic rejection of nomination papers, and disruption of
campaign events. This situation has led to widespread allegations of 'election
engineering' and manipulative practices that could potentially favour certain
political groups, casting doubts over the fairness of the electoral
process.[106][103][107][108] Pakistan's electoral commission was also accused
of gerrymandering in favour of the PML-N during the redrawing of voter maps
before the elections, with a record 1,300 complaints made.[109]

Many candidates affiliated with the PTI complained that following the ban on
the usage of the cricket bat as the party's logo for the ballots, the
electoral commission provided them with symbols carrying obscure meanings and
sometimes awkward connotations such as a calculator, an electric heater, a
dice, a bed, an eggplant, which is deemed anatomically suggestive, and a
bottle, which carries suggestions of alcohol consumption in the majority-
Muslim country.[110][111] This forces some of them to highlight their assigned
symbols to voters, particularly those living in rural areas, on TikTok.[112]

Numerous PTI candidates were reportedly beaten and imprisoned, while many were
compelled to join opposing parties or quit politics entirely. A strict order
was given to stop mentioning Khan's name on television and PTI protests were
suppressed, while PTI supporters were arrested and harassed[91] by the
military, judiciary as well other political parties.[113][13] The majority of
the party leadership found themselves imprisoned or exiled, while PTI rallies
were subjected to attacks and bombings, making campaigning virtually
impossible as candidates were forced into hiding.[114] The Intercept reported
allegations of military involvement in the killing and torture of PTI
supporters, and also noted that Pakistani media was significantly restricted
over the past year, making critical reporting on the army and government
nearly impossible.[18]

On one occasion, Usman Dar, a former member of Imran Khan's cabinet, announced
his resignation from the PTI and also withdrew from the election after police
officials assaulted his elderly mother, Rehana Dar, in her own bedroom. Rehana
Dar subsequently appeared on TV, announcing her intention to enter the
election race and contest against Khawaja Asif. She expressed, "You have
achieved what you wanted by making my son [Usman Dar] step down at gunpoint,
but my son has quit politics, not me. Now you will face me in politics".[10]

Just 48 hours before the voting, a full-page advertisement declaring Nawaz
Sharif as the prime minister was published on the front pages of every
newspaper in the country.[115]

#### Appointment of bureaucrats as electoral officers

For the first time in Pakistan's electoral history since 1985, Chief Electoral
Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja employed the services of the highly
politicized[116] executive bureaucracy, particularly Assistant Commissioners
and Deputy Commissioners, in the key electoral roles of Returning Officers
(RO) and District Returning Officers (DRO).[117] These ROs and DROs are
engaged in all stages of the electoral process: from screening applicants to
consolidation of vote counts, and, finally, provisionally notifying winning
candidates.[118] Traditionally, these posts have been occupied by the lower
judiciary of the country.[119]

On 14 December 2023, Justice Ali Baqar Najafi of the Lahore High Court
suspended the ECP's decision on the petition of the PTI that questioned the
apparent bias of the appointed bureaucrats.[120] However, the next day, a
three-member bench of the Supreme Court, consisting of Qazi Faez Isa, Mansoor
Ali Shah, and Sardar Tariq Masood, set aside this ruling and allowed the DROs
and ROs to be notified from the bureaucracy, meanwhile stopping LHC from
undertaking further proceedings on the petition citing over-reach of
authority.[121]

On 30 December 2023, these ROs rejected a majority of the nomination papers
filed by the leadership of the PTI, including those of the party's chief,
Imran Khan. The PTI's general secretary, Omar Ayub Khan, termed the rejections
as "pre-poll rigging".[122] The party challenged these rejections in the
courts.[123] Many of these rejections were later reversed by the
courts.[124][125][126]

#### Censorship

Further information: Internet censorship in Pakistan

On 26 January 2024, PTI's official website, insaf.pk, and a separate website
made for disseminating information regarding the individual electoral symbols
of the party's candidates were blocked in Pakistan.[127] A voter helpline
created by the party was also blocked.[128] Previously, social media was
blocked in the country during the party's virtual electoral events on at least
three separate occasions as per internet watchdog, NetBlocks.[129][130]

Journalists covering the elections reported a 'near-blanket ban' on their
ability to cover PTI candidates fairly. News channels allegedly received
messages from individuals belonging to Pakistan's military establishment
instructing them to remove all references to PTI in their visuals, graphics,
and talking points.[131]

#### Election day violence and disruptions

Widespread internet disruption, with complete closure of mobile phone
networks, was observed and condemned by Amnesty International as a blunt
attack on the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.[132] On 6
March, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) admitted in its response
to the Sindh High Court (SHC) that the Ministry of Interior had indeed issued
directives to suspend mobile phone services on the election day on 8 February,
due to security concerns and fear of terror related activities.[133]

Several polling stations faced instances of violence, ballot box snatching,
vandalism and gunfire.[134][135][136]

On election day, polling stations were changed randomly, causing confusion and
directing voters to incorrect polling locations.[114]

## Electoral system

The 336 members of the National Assembly consist of 266 general seats elected
by first-past-the-post voting in single-member constituencies,[137] 60 seats
that are reserved for women elected by proportional representation based on
the number of general seats won by each party in each province, and ten seats
that are reserved for non-Muslims elected through proportional representation
based on the number of overall general seats won by each party. Independents
cannot claim reserved seats.[138][139]

The government had passed a bill that required the next general elections to
be held using EVMs (electronic voting machines). This was aimed at ending the
allegations of rigging that have plagued previous elections in Pakistan.
Still, the opposition's opinion was that it would make it extremely easy for
PTI to rig the elections in their favour through security loopholes.[140]

In 2022 when the PTI-led government was ousted through a successful vote of
no-confidence in the National Assembly, the 11 opposition parties, some of
them being long-time rivals, formed a new government and passed the Elections
Amendment Bill, which nullified the use of EVMs in the next general elections.
Hence, EVMs were not used in the current general elections. Instead paper
ballots were once again employed during the elections. Furthermore, overseas
Pakistanis were also prevented from e-voting in these elections because of
this amendment.[141]

### Voting and transmission of results

Further information: Election Commission of Pakistan general election forms

Registered voters in each polling station of an electoral district get two
paper ballots to put a stamp on their preferred candidate for the national and
provincial assembly respectively. These ballots are then counted by a
presiding officer who then transmits the results for their polling station to
the returning officer (RO) in Form 45. Copies of Form 45 are also given to the
observing polling agents of the contesting candidates. The RO then
consolidates these Form 45s, in front of the contesting candidates of the
constituency they are overseeing, to give a provisional result in Form 47
before doing a final consolidation in Form 48. The ECP then uses the data from
Forms 47 and 48 to officially notify elected members for each constituency
using Form 49, provided that no candidate contested the unofficial
consolidated counts given in Form 48.[142]

## Timeline

In July 2023 the ECP invited political parties to submit applications for the
allocation of electoral symbols,[143] given that about 40% of the Pakistani
population is illiterate.[144]

As of 25 July 2023, the total number of registered voters in Pakistan stood
around 127 million as compared to 106 million (including 59.22 million men and
46.73 million women voters) in 2018, according to the data released by the
ECP.[145] According to the figures, the number of eligible female voters stood
at 58.5 million (around 46 per cent of the total registered voters) while the
number of eligible male voters was 68.5 million (about 54 per cent of the
total voters).[146]

In late September the ECP announced that citizens over 18 can update their
voter details until 25 October 2023. The ECP decided to "unfreeze" the
electoral rolls to allow registered voters to rectify or update their
details.[147]

On 2 November 2023, President Arif Alvi and the ECP agreed on holding general
elections on 8 February, after a meeting was held in Aiwan-i-Sadr on the
orders of the Supreme Court. The court had instructed the ECP to consult with
the President on the poll date.[148]

On 15 December 2023, the ECP issued the election schedule. It set 22 December
as the last date for filing nomination papers.[149] On that day however, the
ECP extended the deadline for the submission of nomination papers to 24
December.[150] More than 5,000 people were officially recognized as candidates
for the 266 directly elected seats in the National Assembly, with only 313 of
them being women.[144]

Compared to the 46.89 percent female voter turnout in 2018, the share of
female voters share decreased to 41.3 percent in 2024, while the male turnout
increased from 56.01 percent to 58.7 percent.[151]

According to data from the ECP, over 17,800 candidates contested the elections
for national and provincial assemblies. Among them were 5,160 candidates,
including 312 women and two transgender persons, who competed for 266 general
seats of the National Assembly. The data revealed that the TLP, which debuted
in the 2018 elections nominated more candidates than the country’s two major
parties — the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-
Nawaz (PML-N). The PPP nominated 219 candidates, while the PML-N fielded 212
candidates.[152]

## Opinion polls

Main article: Opinion polling for the 2024 Pakistani general election

In August 2023, the ECP imposed a total ban on entrance and exit polls
including those on official digital media accounts of electronic and print
media outlets.[154] Before the ban, opinion polling in June 2023 by Gallup
Pakistan, the Institute of Public Opinion Research (IPOR) and IRIS showed that
the PML-N had regained its lead over the PTI especially in the country's
largest province, Punjab.[_citation needed_]

## Security concerns and violence

The ECP categorised half the country's 90,675 polling stations as either
"sensitive", meaning there is a risk of violence, or "most sensitive",
indicating a higher risk. The classifications were based on the area's
security situation and history of electoral violence.[155] In Balochistan
Province alone, caretaker provincial home minister Muhammad Zubair Jamali said
that almost 80% of its 5,028 polling stations had been declared
"sensitive".[156]

### Pre-poll violence

On 25 January 2024, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan pledged not to stage attacks
on election rallies and would limit itself to attacking military and police
targets during the election period. This followed the government's decision to
deploy troops in sensitive constituencies after intelligence agencies warned
that militants could target rallies.[157]

Two candidates were killed during the election campaign. On 10 January, Malik
Kaleem Ullah, an independent candidate for the Provincial Assembly of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, was shot dead while on a door-to-door sortie, while on 31
January, Rehan Zaib Khan, an independent candidate affiliated with the PTI,
was killed after gunmen opened fire on his car in a market in Bajaur, Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, in an attack that also injured three people and was claimed by
the Islamic State – Khorasan Province (ISIS-K). On 30 January, four people
were killed and five others injured in an explosion during a PTI rally in
Sibi, Balochistan Province, while on 31 January, 15 people were injured in
attacks on residences and offices of PPP candidates and the election office of
the PML-N in Balochistan, which was partially claimed by the Baloch Liberation
Army.[158] On 7 February, 29 people were killed in explosions outside an
independent candidate's office and an office of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F)
(JUI-F) in Balochistan.[159] Both attacks were claimed by ISIS-K.[160]

### Incidents on election day

The Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the closure of its borders
with Iran and Afghanistan on the eve of the general elections on 8 February,
as a measure to enhance security.[161][162]

Ten minutes before polling stations opened, the interior ministry announced
the suspension of mobile internet services across the country, citing recent
terrorist incidents.[144] NetBlocks director Alp Toker called the outage
"amongst the largest" that they had observed. PPP leader Bilawal Bhutto
Zardari demanded that the government restore services and said its lawyers
would challenge the decision in court.[163] The PTI called the outage a
"cowardly act".[111]

In Balochistan, grenades were thrown at two polling stations by unidentified
individuals. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a soldier was killed in an attack by
gunmen in Kot Azam,[164] while five security personnel were killed in an
attack in Kulachi. A polling station in the same province was shelled by
mortars. Two security officers were killed and nine wounded by an explosion
near a polling station in Lajja, Balochistan, while two people were injured
following 14 "minor blasts" in Gwadar.[105]

### Post-election violence

On 9 February, two PTI workers were killed and 24 others were injured after
clashes broke out between police and PTI supporters demonstrating against
alleged electoral fraud in Shangla District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[165][166] On
10 February, Mohsin Dawar, the leader of the National Democratic Movement who
was running for a national assembly seat in North Waziristan, was seriously
injured in a gun attack in Miranshah.[167] On 11 February, six people,
including a police officer, were killed and five others were injured in
election-related clashes in Larkana.[168] On 12 February, Chaudhry Muhammad
Adnan, a former PTI member of the Punjab Assembly and Independent candidate
for the NA-57 Rawalpindi-VI and PP-19 Rawalpindi-XIII constituencies in
Punjab, was shot dead in Rawalpindi.[169] On 13 February, three people were
killed and five others were injured in a gun attack on a PPP victory rally in
Dera Ismail Khan.[170] On 14 February, two people were killed and 13 others
were injured in clashes between BAP and PPP supporters during a recount
outside the office of the returning officer in Hub, Balochistan.[171]

The election was postponed in the NA-8 Bajaur constituency in Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa due to the killing of candidate Rehan Zaib Khan. Provincial
assembly elections were also postponed in the constituencies of PK-22 and

### Allegations of rigging

Main article: Allegations of rigging in 2024 Pakistani general election

See also: Alleged electoral manipulation in Pakistan

The election saw delays in the reporting of results across thousands of
polling stations, sparking controversy. Initial reports suggested PTI-backed
candidates were leading,[10] but the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP)
refuted these claims.[173] Instances of alleged tampering emerged, including
significant discrepancies in vote counts and unexpected shifts in
results.[174][175][176] PTI officials accused the ECP of manipulation and
initiated legal challenges.[177][178][179] Concerns grew as delays persisted,
with accusations of internet shutdowns aimed at impeding opposition
efforts.[180][112] PTI leaders contested official results, claiming widespread
irregularities and fabrications, prompting legal action and calls for
resignations within the ECP.[181][182] Revelations of electoral fraud
surfaced, including admissions from officials implicated in rigging.[183]
Despite retractions,[184] doubts lingered, leading to urgent calls for
investigations by election monitoring groups like the Free and Fair Election
Network (FAFEN).[185] The Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and
Transparency (PILDAT) underscored declining fairness in its independent
evaluation of the election, advocating for a thorough investigation by the ECP
to address systemic issues.[186]

On 17 February, Rawalpindi Division commissioner Liaquat Ali Chattha resigned
from his post after admitting his role in electoral fraud in the locality
where 11 out of a total of 13 national assembly seats were won by PML-N
candidates.[183] He claimed his office helped candidates, who were trailing in
the actual vote counts by approximately 70,000 votes per candidate, to secure
victory using fake stamps.[187][188] He implicated Chief Electoral
Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja and Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa in the
scheme.[189][190][191][192] The ECP denied the allegations, saying that
divisional commissioners had no direct role in the electoral process, and said
it would launch an inquiry.[189][193] Isa rejected the commissioner's
allegation, calling them "baseless".[194] The PTI also called for an
investigation.[195] Following his announcement, Chattha surrendered to police,
who sealed off his office as part of an investigation.[196] In addition to the
PTI, PML-N senator also demanded the resignation of Sikandar Sultan Raja over
the rigging allegations.[197]

Following Chattha's statement, X (formerly Twitter) was subsequently blocked
in Pakistan,[198][199][200] without explanation. President Alvi commented that
the blocking of social media websites in Pakistan reflected a lack of
intellectual capacity to manage criticism.[201] The government initially
dismissed reports of Twitter being blocked, but a document presented to the
court on 20 March revealed that the Ministry of Interior and intelligence
agencies had ordered the suspension of the website on 17 February, following a
statement of Chattha's alleging election rigging. After more than a month, the
government acknowledged on 20 March that Twitter was blocked in
Pakistan.[202][203][204]

On 22 February however, Chattha retracted his claims of election rigging and
apologised to the ECP, saying that the PTI offered a strong position for
making the allegations.[205][206][184] He also said that his mention of the
Chief Justice of Pakistan was “taken to create mistrust in general public”
against Qazi Faiz Isa.[207]

### Disinformation

Rumors spread on social media claiming that international media outlets had
reported the PTI winning over 150 seats. However, a fact-check conducted by
iVerify found no evidence to support these claims.[208]

The official Twitter account of Imran Khan, the de facto leader of the PTI,
was involved in disseminating false information by sharing a fabricated video
purportedly showing post-election rigging.[209]

### Exit polling

Gallup Pakistan's exit poll survey indicated that the PTI garnered significant
support from educated youth, with 41 percent of its voters being high school-
educated individuals aged 18 to 24 or older. Conversely, the PML-N and the PPP
received more backing from illiterate and middle-pass voters. Among bachelor's
and master's degree holders, 35% supported the PTI, 15% favored the PML-N, and
10% supported the PPP. Meanwhile, the PML-N secured 29% of votes from
illiterate voters, compared to the PPP's 23% and the PTI's 21%. Among middle-
pass voters, 31% voted for the PML-N, 26% for the PTI, and 15% for the PPP, as
per the survey findings.[210]

### International analysis

Media outlets around the world denounced the election as "fraudulent"[18] with
western media characterized the election as already decided, favoring the
military-backed candidate Nawaz Sharif.[114]

_The New York Times_ wrote the election results had caught many off guard, as
the PML-N was widely anticipated to secure a landslide victory with the
backing of the military. The report noted that voters expressed frustration
with the military's interference in politics and opted to vote for PTI
candidates in defiance of the military generals.[211] It went on to say the
election results had humiliated the military establishment and started a new
political crisis in the country.[212] Another article by the same newspaper
said that the growing public discontent with military interference in politics
is likely to pressure Pakistan's army chief General Asim Munir, with his only
options being to reconcile with Imran Khan or push forward with an anti-Khan
coalition, which many analysts believe would be weak and unsustainable.[213]

_The Washington Post_ in its editorial board wrote following the election
outcome, the military's control is being questioned more than ever before,
possibly in decades as for the first time, the military-preferred candidate,
Nawaz Sharif, was unable to win the most seats.[13] In a separate piece, it
wrote that the youth of Pakistan caused the most significant election upset in
the country's recent history saying that the youth is increasingly
discontented with economic uncertainty and blame corruption and political
dynasties. This dissatisfaction is now being expressed more openly on social
media, potentially straining the relationship between civilian leaders and the
military which will have long-lasting effects.[112] It also wrote that the
election results were a humiliation for Sharif, despite being seen as the
favoured candidate of the Pakistani military, which had held significant
influence in determining the prime minister.[214]

France 24 called the election "The 'generals' elections' which turned against
the military". It also dubbed the election as the "most rigged" in the
country's history saying the military was seen as backing Nawaz Sharif.[215]
According to Time, the Pakistani military did everything to "sideline Imran
Khan—and failed," but said that the military was continuing to try and prevent
the PTI from returning to power[216] calling the election result as an
embarrassment for Sharif.[217]

Ryan Grim in an article published by _The Intercept_ wrote the Inter-Services
Intelligence (ISI), was poised to manipulate the election outcome to ensure
Nawaz Sharif's victory. However, they were overwhelmed by the unexpected surge
of PTI support.[114] In a different piece, Grim wrote that the historic
turnout in Pakistan was swamping the military's effort to rig the election and
that the military has proved unable to suppress the populist movement
interrogating its authority.[10] _The Economist_ called the election
"botched", but wrote that the military favours the "shabby" result, fearing
that it would lose its economic benefits shout it give up power.[218] It also
suggested that the despite their efforts, the military leadership did not seem
to have as much control as they believed to prevent Khan from winning.[219] It
also said the election outcome was a strong message to the military and could
potentially mark a shift in its influence over Pakistani politics, while
adding that a prolonged period of political instability could occur in the
short-term. It called the electoral process "dubious" which was preceded by a
coordinated campaign by the military against Imran Khan.[220]

_The Guardian_ noted that suspicions of military rigging arose during election
day due to a nationwide mobile phone blackout and the slow counting of
results, leading to concerns that the military was exerting influence to
secure the PML-N's success.[221] It added that the military's attempts to
influence the election appeared to have been thwarted, particularly due to the
PTI's effective utilization of social media, given the significant levels of
illiteracy in the country.[222] In a separate article, _The Guardian_ noted
analysts' views that the election results and potential weak coalition
government align with the military's interests, protecting their political and
business agendas.[8]

The _Financial Times_ in its editorial called the election results "flawed"
and "shocking", at the same time describing it as a rejection of military
influence.[113] Pakistani columnist Khurram Husain was quoted in a separate
piece in the newspaper as saying that Pakistan will experience not only the
influence of the military but also a collaborative endeavour involving the
judiciary and major political parties to thwart the PTI from assuming
power.[223]

The _New York Post_ , referencing the _New York Times_ article, stated that
this election marks the initial instance in Pakistan's history where a party
has achieved such success without the support of the military and this will
spark a new political chaos in the country.[224] According to the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation the election results did not unfold as per the
military's expectations and had shaken the elite. Hasan Askari Rizvi was
quoted as saying, "This is a negative vote for the policies that the military
was pursuing.".[225]

Sameer Arshad Khatlani in an opinion piece for the _Dhaka Tribune_ wrote
"Election results seem to be blowing up in the military establishment's face
which attempted to make Imran Khan irrelevant by jailing him, cracking down
PTI".[226] Lipika Pelham wrote for the BBC saying despite PTI-backed
independents winning the majority of seats in parliament, they were unlikely
to be permitted to form a government.[227]

During an interview with _The Wire_ , Najam Sethi remarked that Imran Khan and
the PTI had strongly resisted the influence of the military, which led to the
latter resorting to last-minute rigging efforts.[228] _Firstpost_ wrote that
the Pakistani military had experienced a setback, at least temporarily, with
public sentiment turning against it. It also noted that allegations of
electoral fraud by the military put Western countries in a difficult position,
given their historic support of the military to ensure the security of the
country's nuclear arsenal.[229] It added that "General Asim Munir's tenure may
be remembered as one of the darkest for the army, with its reputation
suffering greatly under his leadership." It also raised concern over Munir's
post-election speech, describing it as uncommon.[230] _The Times of India_
also described Munir as the primary loser of the election.[231] _The Indian
Express_ wrote that the unexpected success of the PTI forced the military to
manipulate results to avoid an unfavourable outcome. Consequently, there were
delays in announcing results, and internet and mobile services were suspended
in numerous regions. Meanwhile, Pakistani social media platforms were flooded
with videos depicting alleged rigging and manipulation.[232] The _Deccan
Herald_ wrote that although the election results represented a significant
setback for the military, and would potentially undermine General Munir's
position, but it was unlikely that the military will relinquish its
influential role in determining the next prime minister.[233]

According to Al Jazeera, numerous analysts suggest that Sharif's return to
electoral politics was made possible due to the military's decision to support
him in the election. However, despite this tacit support from the military,
Sharif failed to win.[234]

Foreign Policy wrote that one clear thing is the old methods used to silence
people's voices are no longer effective. A new generation of young voters has
emerged in Pakistan who are calling for a departure from the past and seeking
the ability to elect their leaders, rather than allowing the military, which
has historically dominated politics to maintain control over the country.[91]
In a separate piece, it wrote that one key factor in the PTI's success in the
election was their refusal to let the military control the election's outcome,
despite their efforts to ensure the PTI's defeat, and that the PTI's challenge
to break the military's grip on politics, has sparked some hope for the future
of Pakistan's democracy and wrote that accusations of military's vote
manipulation will further fuel anti-establishment feelings in the
country.[235]

### Reruns

The ECP ordered elections to be held again on 15 February in twenty-six
polling stations of the NA-88 Khushab-II constituency in Punjab after a mob
destroyed election materials at the office of the returning officer. Due to
security issues re-polling was ordered in six polling stations of NA-43 Tank-
cum-Dera Ismail Khan constituency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to be held on 17
February. Elections were also ordered repeated in the provincial assembly
constituencies in PS-18 Ghotki-I in Sindh and PK-90 Kohat-I in Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa after election materials were either stolen or
destroyed.[236][237]

## International observers

In October 2023, the ECP issued invitations to foreign election observers,
emphasizing transparency in the election process.[238] Before the elections,
Pakistan received visa applications from 81 foreign journalists and 38
international observers. Visa applications were processed, and accreditation
was made mandatory for foreign observers upon arrival in Pakistan.[239]
Eligible applicants were in the process of being approved with
visas.[240][241] The Pakistan High Commission in London issued visas to 37
British journalists, including prominent figures such as Christina Lamb of
_The Times_ , allowing them to cover the election proceedings in
Pakistan.[242]

A team from the Commonwealth, led by former Nigerian President Goodluck
Jonathan, was sent to Pakistan to monitor the elections.[243] The Commonwealth
Observer Group (COG), commended the ECP for its role in maintaining peace and
smooth conduct during the elections.[244] Despite the recent suspension of
mobile and internet services, the observers confirmed that the voting process
in Pakistan remained uninterrupted.[245] Jonathan emphasized the importance of
casting votes over internet services. The COG released its initial findings,
acknowledging the efforts of the ECP and other institutions in organizing the
general elections.[246]

The European Union (EU) did not send a full election observation mission as it
had done in previous years. The European Union informed the Pakistani
Government that it would not be able to deploy a full mission due to lack of
time. Instead, a small team of experts visited Pakistan during the elections.
Ambassador of the European Union in Pakistan Ms. Reena Kivinka said that
various government officials have been informed about this decision. Despite
the absence of a full EU observer group, the Election Commission of Pakistan
(ECP) maintained an open-door policy and welcomed an observation mission for
the upcoming general elections. The small EU expert mission was still able to
provide valuable insight into the electoral process.[247][248]

## Aftermath

Protests were held by the PTI and other parties in cities across Pakistan to
protest alleged electoral fraud. Dozens were arrested following protests in
Lahore while highways were blocked in Balochistan.[249] On 14 February, the
JUI-F's leader Fazal-ur-Rehman said that he rejected the election results and
announced that his party would stage protests against the ECP.[250] Awami
National Party provincial president for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Aimal Wali Khan in
a press conference rejected the results of the elections, claiming they were
already decided before voting began. He admitted their past cooperation with
the establishment was a mistake and vowed not to work with them anymore. He
also accused the military of using the country's resources for their
benefit.[251]

On 12 February, Jahangir Tareen and Pervez Khattak announced their decision to
retire from politics entirely, while Siraj-ul-Haq resigned from his position
as the emir of Jamaat-i-Islami.[252] Later, Khattak stepped down as the leader
of the PTI-Parliamentarians[253] while Jamaat-e-Islami unanimously refused to
accept Haq's resignation as its leader.[254]

On 16 February, the PTI held a press conference where they labelled the
election as the "largest voter fraud" in Pakistan's history, targeting the
party and its candidates. They asserted that 85 seats had been unfairly taken
away from them.[255][256]

The party announced plans for nationwide protests on 17 February to denounce
widespread electoral rigging.[257] On the same day, PTI-affiliated candidate
Salman Akram Raja was arrested in Lahore while participating in a
protest.[258]

During the first Senate session after the election, there were widespread
calls by members for an inquiry into the election process, with senators from
the JI and the PTI urging legal action against the chief election
commissioner.[259]

### Formation of a new federal government

On 10 February, in an AI-generated victory speech from prison, Imran Khan
claimed that based on completed forms provided by polling agents, his party
had won a two-thirds majority.[260][261] On 13 February, the PTI announced
that it would try and form a government through its affiliated independent
candidates in the national level and in Punjab with the Majlis Wahdat-e-
Muslimeen (MWM) party. It also said that it would seek to form a coalition
with the Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan (JI) party to lead a government in Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa. Khan had previously said that he would not engage with the
PML-N's Nawaz Sharif and the PPP's Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, calling them
"corrupt".[262] On 14 February, the JI rejected the proposed coalition with
the PTI in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, citing a change in the latter's stance over the
formation of the provincial government, as the PTI only offered a coalition at
the provincial level, not nationally.[263][264]

Nawaz Sharif, whose party won a plurality of seats in parliament, said that he
would seek to build a governing coalition with the PPP.[265] Since the
election, at least six winning independent candidates to the National Assembly
have announced that they would be joining the PML-N, including PTI-affiliated
candidate Waseem Qadir, who was previously a PML-N member until 2018.[266] He
alleged he was abducted and therefore he re-joined PML-N, but skeptics
suggested he was bribed.[18]

After the election results, both Nawaz Sharif and Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, who
were contenders for the prime minister's position, withdrew from the
race.[267] On 13 February, at a press conference at the residence of the
Pakistan Muslim League (Q)'s Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain in Islamabad, the
PML-N's Shehbaz Sharif, the PPP's Asif Ali Zardari, Muttahida Qaumi Movement –
Pakistan's Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, Balochistan Awami Party's Sadiq Sanjrani
and Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party's Aleem Khan announced that their parties had
agreed to form a coalition government.[23] PML-N spokesperson Marriyum
Aurangzeb said that Shehbaz was the prime ministerial nominee following his
elder brother Nawaz's recommendation.[22] PPP leader Bilawal Bhutto Zardari
said that he would endorse a PML-N nominee for prime minister and that the PPP
would not join the next cabinet. He also expressed a desire to see his father
Asif Ali Zardari return as president, and said that his party would field
nominees for the chairmanship of the Pakistani Senate and the speakership of
the National Assembly.[262] A senior PPP leader was quoted as saying that the
party preferred to have a minimal role in the coalition government saying that
"We don't want to take that heavy responsibility."[268] Analysts suggest that
this arrangement seemed to enjoy the backing of the military.[268] JUI-F chief
Fazal-ur-Rehman, a long-time ally of the PML-N, declined to support the PML-N
and instead suggested that the PML-N should sit on the opposition
benches.[267] The coalition agreement between the PML-N and the PPP was
finalized on 20 February, with Shahbaz Sharif as prime minister and Asif Ali
Zardari as president.[269][270] Media termed this coalition as "PDM 2.0" in
reference to the previous coalition led by PML-N and PPP following Imran
Khan's removal as prime minister.[271] Khurshid Shah revealed that the PPP
initially approached the PTI instead of the PML-N to explore possibilities in
forming a government but was turned down by the PTI.[272][273]

Only three weeks before the election, Bhutto Zardari had criticized the PML-N
saying their "policies had hurt the country's economy," and remarked "Fool me
once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me", when asked about the
possibility of entering into a coalition with the PML-N.[274] In response,
Imran Khan called the upcoming coalition a "daylight robbery" and warned
"against the misadventure of forming a government with stolen votes."[275]
Akhtar Mengal, the president of the Balochistan National Party (Mengal), said
that the PML-N and PPP-led coalition would collapse within one and a half
years due to the parties "blackmailing" each other, citing previous coalition
governments.[276] Observers noted that the increased support for the PTI had
changed the power dynamics, making a Sharif-led government seem weak even
before it began.[268] A PML-N leader, speaking anonymously, acknowledged that
the party might not complete its full five-year term if it forms a government
and stated that the party's entire election campaign centred around Nawaz
Sharif becoming the prime minister, which resulted in feelings of betrayal and
disappointment among supporters when Nawaz chose to nominate Shehbaz for the
position instead.[277] JUI-F chief Fazal-ur-Rehman also reiterated his belief
that the incoming coalition government is unlikely to complete its full five-
year tenure.[278] He further cautioned about the risk of a "system collapse"
in the country due to excessive interference from the establishment and added
that the establishment aimed to ensure that people aligned with their
preferences were elected to the assemblies.[279]

On 27 February, a leaked video surfaced showing MQM-P leader Syed Mustafa
Kamal, where he was shown saying during an MQM-P party meeting that PML-N
leaders informed him about the PPP's claim that the "MQM-P's mandate is 100%
fake". Kamal later confirmed the authenticity of this video.[280][281][282]
Later on the same day, Sindh Governor and MQM-P leader Kamran Tessori also
acknowledged in another leaked audio recording that the MQM-P "did not get
votes in this election," and emphasized the difference from the 2018 general
election when MQM-P obtained seven seats, which was their actual vote
bank.[283]

On 16 February, senior PTI official Asad Qaiser said that Imran Khan had
nominated Omar Ayub Khan, a grandson of former military ruler Muhammad Ayub
Khan, as the PTI's nominee for prime minister, despite him being in hiding
over charges relating to the May 9 riots.[284] The PTI also nominated Mian
Aslam Iqbal and Ali Amin Gandapur as its respective nominees for chief
minister in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[285] Later that day however, PTI
official Muhammad Ali Saif stated that the party had chosen to be in the
opposition both at the federal level and in Punjab, following the directives
of Imran Khan.[286]

On 19 February, the PTI announced that it would form an alliance with the
Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) solely to secure its portion of reserved seats in
the National, Punjab, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies.[287][288] Following
the announcement, nearly all PTI-backed independent candidates in national and
provincial assemblies submitted affidavits to the ECP, officially joining the
SIC[289] and approached the ECP to claim their reserved seats. However, the
PPP, the PML-N, and the MQM-P challenged the allocation of reserved seats to
the PTI/SIC bloc, arguing that the latter did not qualify as a "parliamentary
party". PTI chair Gohar Ali also emphasized that an NA session could not be
called without first notifying the reserved seats for the PTI-backed SIC
bloc.[290] The ECP withheld the allocation of 78 out of the total 226 reserved
seats for women and minorities in the national and four provincial assemblies.
By 26 February, these 78 reserved seats were pending allocation to the
PTI/SIC, awaiting the ECP's decision.[291]

#### Inauguration of the National Assembly

President Arif Alvi declined to convene the National Assembly's inaugural
session, which is typically summoned within 21 days of the general elections
as per the constitution. He was also of the view that Assembly was not
complete and therefore the ECP should distribute the reserved seats for women
and minorities to the PTI-backed SIC bloc. As a result, he faced significant
criticism from the PPP and the PML-N[292][293] who asserted that the
President's action amounts to "abrogating the Constitution" by not convening
the session, and warned of potential legal consequences.[294] Imran Khan also
endorsed Alvi's decision to decline the summoning of the session and said that
they were drafting a letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF),[295]
urging for the condition that any of its discussions with the incoming
PML-N/PPP coalition government should be contingent upon an independent audit
of the general election.[296] This action was heavily criticized by the PML-N
and the PPP, who argued that sending such a letter would be tantamount to
inviting foreign intervention in the country's domestic affairs.[297] On 28
February, the National Assembly Secretariat scheduled the inaugural session
for 29 February at 10 a.m., bypassing the need for notification from
Alvi.[298] At the very last moment, Alvi relented and approved a summary for
calling the inaugural session late at night, albeit with reservations about
the tone of the summary from caretaker prime minister Anwaar-ul-Haq
Kakar.[299]

On 29 February, a total of 302 newly elected legislators took their oaths,
marking the commencement of the 16th National Assembly. The maiden session,
however, was disrupted by chaos and slogans in favour of Imran Khan. This was
the first time where PTI MNAs were able (due to parliamentary privilege) to
chant Imran Khan's name and display his photos on live TV since a ban was
imposed on mentioning his name on television. The PTI's nominee for the
premiership, Omar Ayub Khan, along with PTI chair Gohar Ali Khan, emphasized
during their addresses to the session that the Assembly remained incomplete as
MNAs nominated for reserved seats were unable to attend the session and take
the oath.[300][301] On 4 March, a five-member bench of the ECP, chaired by CEC
Sikandar Sultan Raja, delivered a much-awaited 4-1 verdict to dismiss the plea
from the PTI/SIC for reserved seats in the National Assembly. The ruling
stated that the bloc is not eligible for reserved seats and asserted that
leaving reserved seats vacant is not permissible, and thus these seats would
be allocated to other political parties based on their proportional
representation. However, the ECP Punjab member disagreed from the majority
decision.[302] PTI leaders criticised the verdict and vowed to contest the
ECP's ruling in court[303] while several lawyers and activists also criticized
the ECP for its decision.[304] Speaking to the media from jail, Imran Khan
also criticized the denial of reserved seats to the PTI as unconstitutional,
drawing parallels to the disenfranchisement of East Pakistan following the
1970 Pakistani general election which ultimately resulted in the country's
disintegration.[305] On 8 March, several members of the provincial and
national assemblies who were allocated reserved seats, which were denied tp
the PTI/SIC, took their oaths in respective assemblies. This occurred despite
PHC injunctions and notices to the ECP instructing lawmakers not to take their
oaths.[306] On 14 March, the Peshawar High Court dismissed the PTI/SIC
petition challenging the ECP's decision to reject the party's allocation of
reserved women and minority seats.[307] After which some PTI party leaders
made controversial statements attributing PTI's loss of reserved seats in the
parliament to its decision to enter into an alliance with the Sunni Ittehad
Council (SIC).[308]

After the allocation of reserved seats, excluding the PTI/SIC bloc, to other
political parties, the PML-N emerged as the largest party in the National
Assembly, gaining 16 seats to reach 123, while the PPP's count increased to 73
and the JUI-F's to 11. On 6 March, the ECP uploaded Forms 45, 46, 48, and 49
on its website about a month post the election, thereby violating the legal
requirement for their release within 14 days after the polls.[309] In a press
conference, the PTI leaders including Gohar Ali Khan described the Forms 45
released by the ECP on its website as "heavily tampered", resulting in the
outcomes favoring PTI's opponent candidates. They also asserted possession of
"original and signed Form-45s," alleging significant "fraud" in the
compilation of election results.[310][311] The PTI declared their intention to
approach the Supreme Court regarding the purported alteration of Form-45s and
called for a comprehensive and independent audit of the election
outcomes.[312]

On 10 March, the PTI/SIC officially nominated Omar Ayub Khan as the leader of
the opposition in the National Assembly.[313]

On 2 March, Shehbaz Sharif of the PML-N and PTI-backed independent candidate
Omar Ayub Khan submitted their nomination papers for the prime ministerial
elections.[314] The next day on 3 March, Shehbaz was re-elected as Prime
Minister of Pakistan for the second time, securing 201 votes against the 92
votes received by Omar Ayub Khan. Due to the absence of a clear majority for
any single party in the assembly, Shehbaz was elected with the joint support
from PML-N's allies such as the PPP, MQM-P, PML-Q, BAP, PML-Z, IPP, NP among
others.[315][24][316] He would soon afterwards be officially sworn in.[317]
During the session, PTI-backed SIC MNAs chanted slogans alleging that Shehbaz
came to power through rigging[318] with Omar Ayub terming the Shahbaz' PM
election as 'illegal'. Omar Ayub Khan also condemned censorship in his speech
after the state-run Pakistan Television Corporation was reported to have
abruptly ceased live broadcasting as soon as he had started to speak,
comparing it with live coverage of Shehbaz's statements.[319][320]

The cabinet of Shehbaz Sharif was formally sworn in by President Asif Ali
Zardari on 11 March.[321]

#### Election of the President

Main article: 2024 Pakistani presidential election

The coalition agreement which was reached also called for Asif Ali Zardari to
return as President of Pakistan.[317] On 3 March, the police conducted a raid
on Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PKMAP) leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai who was
also a presidential candidate in the 2024 Pakistani presidential election
contesting against PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari. The PKMAP claimed that the
raid was a reaction following a speech delivered by Achakzai in the National
Assembly[322] where he criticized the "establishment" for their interference
in the polls.[323][324] On 8 March, Achakzai, in a letter to the ECP requested
the postponement of the presidential elections, citing concerns that holding
elections without reserved seats in the assemblies would be unconstitutional.
However, the ECP dismissed Achakzai's request.[325]

On 9 March, Zardari secured his second term as President of Pakistan with the
backing of the PML-N and rest of the ruling coalition in a vote held by the
national and provincial assemblies. Zardari received 411 votes, while Achakzai
received 181 votes.[326] The PTI denounced the vote as "illegal," asserting
that the election of the "king of corruption," referring to Zardari, was
forced upon the nation.[327]

### Formation of provincial governments

On 23 February 2024, the 18th Punjab Assembly convened approximately 313 newly
elected MPAs were sworn in. This included 193 from the PML-N, 98 PTI-backed
independents, 13 from the PPP, 10 from the PML-Q, five from the IPP, and one
each from the TLP and the PML-Z.[328] On 26 February, Nawaz Sharif's daughter,
Maryam Nawaz, was elected as the first female chief minister of Punjab with
220 votes in the assembly,[329] while her opponent PTI-backed candidate Rana
Aftab Ahmad Khan boycotted the elections.[330] The next day, the PTI announced
that it would convene a separate Punjab Assembly session to select its chief
minister, speaker, and deputy speaker, asserting a majority with 250 MPAs,
including those from reserved seats for women and minorities. They labeled the
election of Maryam Nawaz to the chief ministership "a stolen mandate" and
asserted that she was defeated on her provincial assembly seat from PP-159
Lahore-XV by a PTI-backed candidate, Mehr Sharafat.[331]

On 24 February, 147 MPAs of the 16th Sindh Assembly took their oath of
office,[332] of which 84 MPAs from the PPP, 28 from the MQM-P, 14
independents, including those backed by the PTI, and two each from the GDA and
JI.[333] On 26 February, PPP leader Syed Murad Ali Shah was re-elected as the
Sindh Chief Minister for a third consecutive term, receiving 112 votes. His
opponent, Ali Khursheedi of the MQM-P, garnered 36 votes.[334]

On 28 February, the 12th Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa convened as
more than 115 newly elected MPAs were sworn in. Among those sworn in were 87
PTI-backed SIC lawmakers, nine from the JUI-F, eight from the PML-N, five from
the PPP, two from the PTI-Parliamentarians, and four independents.[335] The
next day, Ali Amin Gandapur, a PTI backed independent candidate was elected as
the Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, securing 90 votes. His opponent,
Ibadullah Khan of the PML-N, received 16 votes.[336]

On 28 February, 57 newly elected MPAs of the 12th Baloch Assembly were sworn
in where the PPP and the PML-N emerged as the two largest parties.[337] On
March 2, Sarfraz Bugti was elected unopposed as the new Chief Minister of
Balochistan with the joint support of the PPP and the PML-N.[338]

## Reactions

### Domestic

After polling closed, caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar ul Haq Kakar said that
the elections were a "momentous occasion". He praised the enthusiasm of the
people of Pakistan and expressed appreciation for their participation in the
polling process, adding that "the high voter turnout is a clear indication of
public commitment to shaping the future of our country."[339]

Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja thanked the nation for the
successful election and expressed gratitude to all stakeholders, including
government bodies, security agencies, media, and voters. He urged returning
officers to ensure timely results delivery.[340] The Pakistan Armed Forces,
through its media wing ISPR, extended congratulations to the nation for the
peaceful conduct of the general elections, emphasizing their role in advancing
democracy and fulfilling the aspirations of the people.[341] Chief of the Army
Staff (COAS) Asim Munir urged citizens to move on from the politics of
"anarchy and polarization", adding that a stable hand was needed to unite
"Pakistan's diverse polity", and to make "democracy functional and
purposeful".[342] During the first Corps Commanders’ Conference held at the
Pakistani military headquarters following the election and chaired by Asim
Munir, the military rejected claims of election interference.[343]

President Arif Alvi, stated that the use of electronic voting machines (EVMs)
could have averted the uncertainty surrounding the election results and
reminded of his efforts to introduce them in the country's electoral
process.[344]

In a message from jail, Imran Khan claimed that the PTI won 170 seats,
achieving a two-thirds majority in the 2024 elections.[345] He emphasized the
power of the electorate and called for the protection of their votes.[345]
According to Khan's sister, Aleema Khan, he described the rigging as the
"Mother of all rigging" and ridiculed the PML-N, saying "Instead of honouring
the vote, the 'selected ones' have honoured the boot," implying that the PML-N
prioritized military influence over respecting the electoral process.[346]

The Pakistan Foreign Ministry in a statement expressed surprise at
international criticism regarding the elections, citing the complexity of the
electoral process and the strong participation of millions of
voters.[347][348]

The day after the election, the Pakistan Stock Exchange shed 2,200 points on
opening, or 3.6% of its value, as delayed results and prospects of a hung
parliament loomed.[349]

_Dawn_ in its editorial titled "Respect the mandate" stated it is becoming
increasingly clear that there is widespread anger and resentment towards the
military's continuous involvement in civilian affairs, and urged the armed
forces to abandon its grudge against the PTI. It added that "though the
public's decision was quite evident, some quarters still attempted to stamp
their will over the election results." It also noted that "the state must
realise that, sometimes, a vote for the underdog is a vote against the
establishment".[350] Dawn referred to the largest number of independent
candidates winning in a party-based election as a significant development in
Pakistan's electoral history, describing it as a "seismic shift" and a clear
message from the public that sidelining PTI and depriving them of their
election symbol would not alter the election's trajectory.[351]

_The Express Tribune_ in its editorial stated "the fact that the people of
Pakistan have made a choice, and have voted for parliamentary democracy must
come as a soothing consolation."[352] Hamid Mir stated that PML-N supporters
claimed to have received more votes on the day after the election.[353]

Hina Jilani, co-founder of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, expressed
her astonishment at the election outcome, stating that she, like everyone
else, was taken aback, saying that "It's strange for me to say this, but I
don't think the Pakistani public has ever played a strong role in enforcing
democracy in this country." and that "we have not seen a public uprising
against the military takeover of political space in this country."[354]

The day after the election concluded, several notable Pakistani journalists,
which include Syed Talat Hussain, Meher Bukhari, and Hamid Mir, took to
Twitter to openly criticize the ECP, labeling its performance as a 'farcical
failure' due to its inability to efficiently deliver election results.[355]

### International

  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Flag_of_Australia_%28converted%29.svg/23px-Flag_of_Australia_%28converted%29.svg.png) Australia – The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in a press statement expressed regret saying that "the Pakistani people were restricted in their choice, since not all political parties were allowed to contest these elections."[356]
  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Flag_of_Europe.svg/23px-Flag_of_Europe.svg.png) European Union – High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell called upon the relevant authorities to "ensure a timely and full investigation of all reported election irregularities and to implement the recommendations of the upcoming EU Election Expert Mission report."[357]
  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png) United Kingdom – Foreign Secretary David Cameron in a statement noted "serious concerns raised about the fairness and lack of inclusivity of the elections" while also acknowledging "the restrictions imposed on internet access on polling day, significant delays to the reporting of results and claims of irregularities in the counting process".[358]
  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png) United States – In a rare strong statement,[18] State Department spokesman Matthew Miller called for a "full investigation into the claims of interference or fraud" during the elections while reiterating to work with whoever forms the next government.[359][360] Several US lawmakers expressed concerns over the conduct of polls, poll-related violence, and restrictions on freedom of speech.[361] White House spokesperson expressed concern about "intimidation and voter suppression," emphasizing that they were closely monitoring the situation in Pakistan.[362]

Following the election, Pakistan's classification in the Democracy Index was
revised downward by the Economist Intelligence Unit, shifting it from a hybrid
regime to an authoritarian regime.[363]

On 27 February, Moody's retained Pakistan's ratings at 'Caa3' with a stable
outlook. Nevertheless, the agency emphasized significantly high risks of
liquidity and external vulnerability challenges, terming the election
"controversial." The agency suggested that this situation could severely limit
the decision-making capacity of the incoming coalition government.[364]
Earlier in February 2023, Moody's downgraded Pakistan's rating from Caa1 to
Caa3.[365]

On 28 February, at least 31 members of the United States Congress wrote a
letter to US President Joe Biden, urging him to withhold recognition of the
incoming coalition government until a "thorough, transparent, and credible"
audit of the election is conducted. The letter also demanded that the United
States cease military and other cooperation with Pakistan.[366][18] Among
those critical of the results was Congressman Ro Khanna who also alleged that
the Pakistani military was backing Nawaz Sharif.[367] In an interview,
Congressman Greg Casar expressed concerns about American hypocrisy regarding
Pakistani democracy, stating that he has directly contacted the State
Department about it. He also warned Pakistan's Ambassador to the United States
that existing laws could be utilized to reduce aid to Pakistan due to its
human rights abuses.[368]

On 8 March, in an unusual political statement, the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) urged Pakistani authorities to resolve all electoral disputes fairly and
peacefully.[369]

On 20 March, a Congressional hearing titled "Pakistan After the Elections:
Examining the Future of Democracy in Pakistan and the US-Pakistan
Relationship" took place, during which Donald Lu provided testimony before a
subcommittee of the US House Committee on Foreign Affairs.[370] Lu stated that
the term "free and fair" was never used to describe the 2024 Pakistani
elections and recommended that the ECP investigate allegations of election
fraud. Additionally, he warned that if the ECP fails to address these
allegations, it could negatively impact America's relationship with
Pakistan.[371]

  10. **^** This is a column that lists the percentage of undecided voters and non-voters in certain polls that publish this data. As some polls do not publish any data on undecided voters and non-voters, the columns with survey participants who had a preference when polled are all that is needed to reach 100%. In surveys that do include data on non-voters and undecided voters, a scaling factor is applied to the margin of error and the rest of the data (for example, if the number of undecideds and non-voters equals 20%, each party would have their vote share scaled up by a factor of 100/80 (the formula is 100/(100-UndecidedPercentage)). This is done to keep consistency between the different polls and the types of data they provide.
  11. **^** This poll or crosstabulation did not include any data about undecided voters or non-voters and cut them out completely from the published results.
