The **2024 Edo State gubernatorial election** took place on Saturday, 21
September 2024, to elect the governor of Edo State. The incumbent PDP
governor, Godwin Obaseki, was ineligible to contest for re-election, having
already served two terms as allowed by the constitution of Nigeria.

The All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Senator Monday Okpebholo, was
declared the winner of the election by the Independent National Electoral
Commission (INEC) on 22 September 2024. Okpebholo won with a total of 291,667
votes, defeating the PDP candidate, Asue Ighodalo, who garnered 247,274 votes,
and the Labour Party (LP) candidate, Olumide Akpata, who came third with
22,763 votes.

## Background

[edit]

Godwin Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was term-limited and
ineligible to run for re-election in 2024. His tenure was marked by a shift
from the APC to the PDP, and his exit from the political scene in Edo State
paved the way for a highly contested election. The 2024 election was seen as a
three-horse race among the APC, PDP, and LP.[1][2]

## Results

[edit]

The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) announced the results on
22 September 2024. Senator Monday Okpebholo of the APC won the election,
securing victory in 11 of the state's 18 Local Government Areas (LGAs),
including key areas like Etsako West, Akoko Edo, and Oredo. PDP’s Asue
Ighodalo won in seven LGAs, while Labour Party candidate Olumide Akpata did
not win in any LGA.[3]

## Primaries

[edit]

### PDP Primary

[edit]

The PDP primary was held on 22 February 2024, with lawyer and businessman Asue
Ighodalo emerging as the party's candidate after securing 99.83% of the vote.
The primary was relatively smooth, despite a parallel primary that attempted
to nominate the incumbent deputy governor, Philip Shaibu.[4]

### APC Primary

[edit]

The APC primary produced Senator Monday Okpebholo as its candidate. Okpebholo,
a senator representing Edo Central senatorial district since 2023, ran on a
platform to continue the developmental projects initiated by former governor
Adams Oshiomhole.[5]

## Controversies

[edit]

The election was not without controversy, as PDP and Governor Obaseki alleged
electoral malpractices, accusing INEC of favoring the APC. The PDP also raised
concerns about arrests of its members during the lead-up to the election, and
some protests occurred at the collation center.[6][7]
