The **2024 New Brunswick general election** was held on October 21, 2024,
where 49 members were elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick. It
was formally called upon the dissolution of the 60th New Brunswick Legislature
on September 19, 2024.[2]

The incumbent Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick (PC) government,
led by Premier Blaine Higgs since 2018, sought re-election to a third
consecutive term. The party was defeated by the New Brunswick Liberal
Association, led by Susan Holt, with them set to form a majority government in
a landslide victory. Higgs was defeated in his own riding of Quispamsis, the
first time since 1987 that a sitting New Brunswick Premier lost in their own
riding. Upon taking office, Holt became the first woman premier of New
Brunswick.

## 2023 redistribution

[edit]

The Electoral Boundaries and Representation Commission is obliged after every
second general election to investigate and report whether boundary adjustments
are required to the Province's constituencies.[3] It was required to ensure
that revised constituencies have populations that fall within 25% of the
determined electoral quotient, and it made its report with recommendations in
March 2023.[4]

Objections were raised as to the alignments proposed for Shediac-Cap-Acadie
and Tantramar, specifically with respect to the eastern portion of Cap-Acadie
(a francophone-majority town) having been placed in the latter,[5] and special
legislation was passed to allow a variance in the proposed boundaries.[6]

## Background

[edit]

The _Legislative Assembly Act_ was amended in 2017 to provide that an election
should be held every four years on the third Monday in October;[7] the
election still must be held on a Monday if called sooner.[8]

### Minor party deregistrations and registrations

[edit]

On October 31, 2020, after failing to nominate ten candidates in the 2020
election, the KISS NB was deregistered.[9]

On March 30, 2022, Kris Austin and Michelle Conroy announced their departures
from the People's Alliance to join the Progressive Conservatives explaining
they believed they could better represent their ridings from within
government.[10][11] Premier and Progressive Conservative leader Blaine Higgs
reiterated the party's support for official bilingualism when questioned about
the People's Alliance's previous stances on the issue which were criticized by
the Acadian Society of New Brunswick.[11] The Peoples Alliance was
deregistered on March 31, 2022, but re-registered by interim leader Rick
DeSaulniers in May 2022.[12][13][14]

The Libertarian Party of New Brunswick was registered in July 2024, and put
forward candidates in 18 ridings.[15][16]

In September 2024, the Social Justice Party of New Brunswick and the Consensus
NB Party were created, however both failed to nominate at least 10 candidates
as required to maintain party status and each will be deregistered following
the 2024 election.[17][18]

## Issues

[edit]

### Education

[edit]

New Brunswick has been experiencing major education shortcomings during the
2020s, with the province experiencing massive shortages in teachers and school
psychologists,[23][24] along with school bus drivers in some areas. Schools
throughout the province have also reported exceptionally low child literacy
rates, with a 2021–22 report concluding that literacy standards were not met
by around 40% of the province's fourth grade students, the lowest it has been
in 18 years.[25] Kelly Lamrock, the New Brunswick Child and Youth advocate,
further reported that child literacy rates had declined by 29% over the past
decade.[26] After being released in November 2023, the 2022–23 report for
fourth grade student literacy rates showed further decline, with 43.4% scoring
"below appropriate achievement" after being assessed for English reading.[27]

In late 2023, the New Brunswick Teachers' Association (NBTA) called for the
provincial government to address concerns raised from an internal survey of
its members. Among the concerns noted were "understaffed classrooms and
overcrowded buildings, with uncertified community members, people without a
bachelor of education, sometimes taking the place of actual teachers because
of shortages." Many of the 2,916 survey participants reported teaching in
overcrowded and poorly ventilated schools, with half also experiencing verbal
and physical abuse. Those who called for these issues to be addressed included
Liberal leader Susan Holt as well as Kevin Arseneau, a Green MLA for Kent
North.[28]

In May 2024, the NBTA projected over 1,200 anglophone teachers that will be
eligible for retirement within the next five years, with Peter Lagacy, the
NBTA president, adding that this is "an alarming number when we look at how
many we have coming into the system."[29]

#### Staff shortages

[edit]

New Brunswick's public school system has been notably experiencing shortages
in teachers,[30][31] school psychologists and, in certain areas, bus
drivers.[32]

While proposing changes for Policy 713, Higgs proposed for "extra counsellors,
extra support." According to figures from November 2023, however, the number
of school psychologists dropped; out of a total of 28 "full-time equivalent"
school psychologist positions filled throughout the province, only six served
the province's English school system of approximately 73,000 students.[23]

#### School busing shortcomings

[edit]

An audit which took place between January and February in 2024 concluded that
the provincial Department of Education "lacks oversight on school bus safety
and driver requirements."[33] Using a sample size of 65 bus drivers out of a
total of around 1,300, the audit reported that 46% of New Brunswick's school
bus drivers had ineligible licensing requirements. Additionally, 20% were
hired without checking for criminal records, and further percentages of bus
drivers had no evidence of bus training (37%) and first aid training (42%).
The audit also conducted vehicle inspections on a number of buses, with 45%
having deficiencies.[34][35] Francine Landry, the Liberal MLA for Madawaska
Les Lacs-Edmundston, criticized the provincial government led by Higgs for
"touting their record on keeping children safe, while failing to fulfil the
most basic requirements for doing so." Education Minister Bill Hogan
responded, saying that "clearly there's some work to be done in that area in
making sure that they're inspected on time."[33]

#### Policy 713

[edit]

Main article: Policy 713

Policy 713, a provincial education policy which sets minimum requirements for
public schools and districts in the province related to individuals
identifying and perceived as LGBTQIA2S+, became the subject of massive debate
following a 2023 decision made to review and ultimately revise the policy by
the Progressive Conservative-led government under Higgs and Bill Hogan, the
Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. In the aftermath of its
revision, a third of the Progressive Conservative caucus members elected under
Higgs have either resigned or announced that they would not seek re-election,
with some criticizing Higgs' leadership and highlighting a growing disconnect
between their personal beliefs and the party's stance. The revision has led to
the government becoming involved in legal disputes with its education
departments as well as with the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, who
filed a lawsuit against the government, citing violations against the
_Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms_ and New Brunswick's human rights and
education acts. The issue has been the subject of widespread coverage and
dispute, and has been covered by major news publications including _The
Washington Post_ ,[36] _The New York Times_ ,[37] and BBC.[38]

Lindsay Jones of _The Globe And Mail_ called the Policy 713 dispute as having
"emerged as perhaps the key issue in the next election."[39]

### Healthcare

[edit]

Healthcare in New Brunswick has been described as being in a "state of
chaos,"[40] with hospitals throughout the province experiencing an
overcapacity of patients,[41] excessively long waiting times,[42] and health
workers experiencing burnout.[43] During a February 2023 press conference,
Blaine Higgs stated that "if every doctor in our province took two or three
more patients a week, we wouldn't have a backlog."[44] In an Angus Reid survey
that recorded Canadians' satisfaction with how their province is dealing with
healthcare, New Brunswick recorded the largest drop in satisfaction rate
compared to rates surveyed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a
rate of just 11 percent, compared to a previous rate of 42 percent.[45]

Following overcrowding at the Dr. Everett Chalmers Regional Hospital emergency
room at the start of 2024, Green leader David Coon called for "immediate
changes" as well as for the government to increase funding.[46]

According to Rob McKee, the Liberal health critic, 160,000 people in New
Brunswick, or roughly 20 percent of the population, do not have a family
doctor or nurse practitioner as of late May 2024. The numbers were disputed by
Bruce Fitch, the Minister of Health.[47]

During the final session of the 60th legislature held on June 7, 2024, Higgs
and Holt clashed during question period; one of the topics included the
funding spent on travel nurses, amounting to nearly CA$174 million, which was
revealed to have been "partly mismanaged" according to a report by the auditor
general.[48]

Both the Liberal and Green parties made promises to re-launch research efforts
into the province's mysterious neurological disease upon forming majority
government.[49]

### Housing

[edit]

Since 2019, housing prices have nearly doubled in New Brunswick. In home
prices, the province marked the highest percentage of increases compared to
the rest of the Canadian provinces and territories.[50] New Brunswick has also
seen major increases in homelessness within its communities and cities, with
Fredericton, Saint John, and Moncton collectively experiencing an 80% increase
in homelessness between 2021 and 2023.[51] Housing critics have claimed that
"landlords have almost all the power" in the province.[52]

Both the Liberal and Green parties have attempted to implement rent regulation
in the province,[53] with the right to housing being highlighted by the Green
Party legislative members, whether to consider it a human right or to push for
rural area housing rights. During a legislative session on November 20, 2020,
held shortly after the opening of the 60th legislature, Green Party leader
David Coon introduced _Bill 18_ , which would have made changes to the
_Residential Tenancies Act_ , including a cap on annual rent increases as well
as ensuring that "rent can only be raised once a year for a tenant and not in
their first year." At the time, New Brunswick was the only province that
allowed for landlords to make multiple increases on rent each year. Coon added
that "we need to ensure that tenants who cannot afford large increases in
their rents are not left out in the cold without housing this winter."[52]
After six months of debate, the bill was ultimately rejected after all
Progressive Conservative and People's Alliance MLAs unanimously voted against
it. The New Brunswick Coalition for Tenants Rights, who had criticized the
proposed bill for "not going far enough," expressed disappointment in the
government decision.[54]

In March 2022, the government introduced a temporary 3.8% rent cap,[55] set to
expire at the end of the year.[56] Opposition parties soon afterwards called
for an extension on this cap, while it was opposed by the government.[57]
Coon, saying that the government has not "gone far enough to eliminate
loopholes that allow landlords to get around the government's temporary cap on
rent increases," also made proposals to the provincial bill to address
loopholes in this legislation, but faced rejection from the majority
Progressive Conservatives.[58]

In December 2023, St. Stephen mayor Allan MacEachern declared a state of
emergency due to an increase in homelessness after the recent death of a
homeless person in the municipality; the declaration also accused the
provincial government of failing to offer housing and social services.[59][60]
Public Safety Minister Kris Austin terminated the declaration soon
afterwards,[61] likening it to car accidents by saying that "people die all
the time in car accidents, and we do not declare state of emergencies for
that."[62] Austin also blamed "leftist agendas that are degrading our society"
as well as the federal government for the issue.[63]

In June 2024, the provincial government quietly made changes to its renting
policies, allowing for landlords to make annual rent increases for up to 4.7%
for the next year starting in July 2024; this increase exceeds the current
inflation rate.[64][65] Coon criticized this change, calling out Higgs as
"caving to the lobbying of large corporate property owners."[66]

### Out-of-province activities

[edit]

New Brunswick, unlike most provinces, allows political party funding from non-
residents. In January 2024, Liberal and Green leaders Holt and Coon both made
a promise to forbid New Brunswick political party donations from out-of-
province sources in response to Higgs going to Alberta and British Columbia on
a fundraising trip for his party.[67]

In August 2024, right-leaning lobbyist group Campaign Life Coalition mailed
flyers to 160,000 homes in New Brunswick,[68] making the accusation that
schools in the province are "pushing transgenderism".[69] Both Liberal and
Green leaders condemned the flyers, with Higgs additionally having been urged
to do so as well.[68]

### Progressive Conservative

[edit]

In November 2023, the Progressive Conservatives hired Steve Outhouse as its
campaign manager. Outhouse had previously served as chief of staff and as
director of communications for federal Conservative cabinet ministers, and
served as campaign manager for the re-election of the United Conservative
Party in the 2023 Alberta general election.[72] In April 2024, Outhouse was
also hired as principal secretary to Premier Blaine Higgs, which is a
taxpayer-funded position that will earn up to CA$124,656 during the six-month
contract.[73] The contract drew criticism from Green leader David Coon, who
estimated the position's pay band as being at a much lower rate of
CA$150,000–175,000 annually,[74] as well as from Liberal MLA and former
Progressive Conservative Robert Gauvin, who stated that it was "unfair that
New Brunswick taxpayers are paying him for that," believing that "this
contract should be cut and the money should be reimbursed."[73] Higgs defended
the value of the contract by reading extensively from Outhouse's resumé and
stating that he comes with, "an extensive degree of credentials and relevant
experience to what we experience as a government."[75]

Jacques Poitras of CBC News described the Progressive Conservative campaign
under Outhouse's contract as adopting "a more pointed, aggressive style of
advertising against the opposition Liberals." The campaign particularly
attacked Susan Holt while "trying to link her to Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau's carbon tax and other policies." Jeff Carr, a Progressive
Conservative MLA who previously announced that he would not be seeking
candidacy in the election, criticized a post his party made targeting a 2014
quote by Holt regarding "closing some schools in the province." Carr stated
that the post omitted important context "for political gain (misleading the
electorate)," calling it "disappointing."[73]

The Progressive Conservative party launched their re-election campaign at a
Quispamsis church on September 19, 2024.[76] Blaine Higgs received critical
attention for telling a joke about a deceased Liberal voter at the end of his
campaign launch speech,[77] with Susan Holt describing it as "a complete lack
of judgment on the premier's part".[78] David Coon additionally criticized the
joke, stating that "to call it a joke would suggest it was funny, and there
was nothing funny about it".[79]

The Progressive Conservative campaign has consisted of promoting its promise
to lower the harmonized sales tax (HST) from 15% to 13%,[80] and highlighting
the fiscal surpluses under their government. The campaign has also promoted
fears of an elected Liberal government taking the province "back into the
red",[81] referring to the consecutive deficits under the previous Liberal
government, during which Susan Holt served as senior economic development
advisor to then-Premier Brian Gallant.[82]

The Progressive Conservatives released their campaign platform on October 12,
2024.[83]

### Liberal

[edit]

Throughout the months leading up to the election, Liberal leader Susan Holt
started distancing herself from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau amongst attacks
from the Progressive Conservatives attempting to link them together throughout
the decline in popularity for Trudeau. Holt stated that "the New Brunswick
Liberal Party is a separate entity from the federal party the prime minister
leads."[84]

When asked by Brunswick News about her summer campaign plans, Holt shared
plans of touring around the province and stopping by each riding, with 207
"touchpoints" with "festivals and celebrations," while also focusing on her
home riding.[8]

The Liberal party officially launched their election campaign in Fredericton
on September 8, 2024.[85]

The Liberals released their campaign platform on October 3, 2024.[86] The
platform's costing table was flagged by media and criticized by the
Progressive Conservatives for a seeming mistake that resulted in counting a
portion of HST revenue twice.[87][88] The error suggests that instead of a net
surplus of $549million over five years, the platform's implementation would
result in a net deficit of over $1billion.[89]

### Greens

[edit]

In late 2023, Green Party leader David Coon stated that his goal was to "elect
as many Green MLAs as possible." Additionally, Coon proposed that he would be
open to the idea of collaborating with the Liberals to prevent Higgs from
remaining in power if an early election resulted in the PCs losing their
majority. Coon's negotiation proposal reflected his stance from the 2018
election when he was willing to talk with both parties, prior to the
Progressive Conservatives securing the backing from the People's Alliance.[90]

Coon, like Holt, was also asked by Brunswick News about his campaign plans for
the summer; he shared that he, along with his deputies, Kevin Arseneau and
Megan Mitton, are going to be "fanning out across the province, launching new
candidates' campaigns that haven't been launched yet, and attending festivals
and events, and generally holding our own events as well." Coon said that the
largest issues that all Green candidates have noticeably heard are healthcare,
along with "affordability and affordable housing," adding that "People want to
see change. They want to see change that's for the better, not change back."
Coon also highlighted a lack in rural development in the province, mentioning
that "there's plenty of talk about communities losing services" in rural
areas.[8]

The Green Party's fall campaign officially launched on September 18, 2024.[91]
During his campaign launch speech, Coon confirmed that he will have a "wish
list" ready to bring into negotiations with other parties, in anticipation of
the Green Party not forming government and no other party getting a majority
of seats. Higgs has compared the Greens potentially providing confidence to a
Liberal government to the "coalition" between the Liberal Party of Canada and
the New Democratic Party at the federal level, despite the Liberal-NDP
arrangement being a confidence and supply agreement and not a coalition as
it's usually defined.[92]

## Debates

[edit]

On May 28, 2024, a CUPE Local 1292-sponsored leaders' debate covering the
topic of healthcare was aired on Rogers TV;[93] Blaine Higgs, Susan Holt and
David Coon were invited to participate, though Higgs declined to attend.[94]

On September 25, 2024, a leaders' debate between Higgs, Holt, and Coon took
place at the Capitol Theatre in Moncton. The debate was aired on CBC
Television and was moderated by Clare MacKenzie and Jacques Poitras.[95]

On October 9, 2024, a leaders' debate between Holt, Coon, and Alex White took
place at the Tom Morrison Theatre at Fredericton High School. Higgs and Rick
DeSaulniers were invited but declined to attend. The debate was aired on
Rogers TV and moderated by Andrew Holland.[96][97]

On October 11, 2024, a Forum "Women Count!" with the party leaders was
organized by the NB Coalition for Equity Pay. Susan Holt, David Coon and Alex
White were present. Higgs declined the invitation. They discussed women issues
in the Province. The Forum was broadcast on Rogers TV.

On October 16, 2024, a leaders' roundtable will be held at St. Thomas
University in Fredericton, hosted by CTV Atlantic.[98]

New Brunswick has 568,901 eligible voters. Advance polling took place on
October 12 and 15, 2024.[108] On October 21, multiple news outlets projected a
Liberal Majority government. The result was projected roughly 36 minutes after
the polls closed. Susan Holt will become the first female premier in New
Brunswick.[109] Premier Blaine Higgs lost his own seat in the riding of
Quispamsis. Five other cabinet ministers were also defeated.
