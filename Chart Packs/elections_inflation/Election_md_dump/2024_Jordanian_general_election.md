**General elections** were held in Jordan on 10 September 2024 to elect the
20th House of Representatives, the lower house of the Parliament of
Jordan.[2][3]

## Background

[edit]

On 25 July 2024, King Abdullah II of Jordan issued a royal decree to dissolve
the House of Representatives. This dissolution preceded parliamentary
elections set for September 10. The previous House of Representatives had been
elected in November 2020.

These elections follow reforms that lowered the candidacy age from 30 to 25,
and allow for a mixed proportional representation system for 138 seats. The
new system allows two votes for each person, one vote for lists running in 18
local districts competing for 97 seats, and another for political parties for
the national district for 41 seats, with 12 quotas for the Christian,
Circassian, and Chechen minorities, as well as 18 seats for women. In upcoming
elections, the percentage of seats for the national district is expected to
increase until parliamentary majorities allow for formation of parliamentary
governments.[4]

On 13 June, the Islamic Action Front, the largest opposition party in Jordan,
sent a letter to Prime Minister Bisher Khasawneh, complaining of “electoral
harassment” practiced against potential candidates and supporters by the
kingdom’s security services.[5]

Starting on 16 August, fake election posters went viral showing _The Boys_
actor Antony Starr as Homelander, photo-shopped to look like a politician
being plastered across the country to satirize candidate Khaled Musa Issa Abu
Hassan's strategy of putting up an unseemly amount of posters to cover up most
public spaces.[6]

Just two days before the election, a Jordanian truck driver killed three
Israeli guards at the country's border crossing with the West Bank, in the
first such attack since the 1990s.[7]

## Electoral system

[edit]

The elections were the first to be held after a series of constitutional
amendments and a new electoral and political parties laws that enabled new
changes, recommended by the Royal Committee to Modernize the Political System.
These new changes include lowering the candidacy age from 30 to 25, and allows
for a mixed electoral system. The new proportional representation system
allows two votes for each person, one vote for open lists running in 18 local
districts, and another closed list for political parties for the national
district. Out of the 138 seats of the House, 97 are for representatives from
local district, and 41 for representatives from the national district, with 12
quotas for the Christian, Circassian, and Chechen minorities, as well as 18
seats for women's quota. Despite the quotas, these groups can also compete in
non-quota seats. In upcoming elections, the percentage of seats for the
national district is expected to increase until parliamentary majorities allow
for formation of parliamentary governments.[4]

## Election

[edit]

937 candidates on 172 lists ran for the 97 seats of the 18 local electoral
districts, while 686 candidates on 25 lists belonging to 36 parties[_which?_]
ran for the 41 seats of the national district. There were a total of 5,115,219
registered voters.

Polling opened at 07:00 and closed at 19:00.[8]

## Aftermath

[edit]

The Islamic Action Front saw significant gains, winning 31 seats; however,
this was not enough to win a majority outright.[7] This was the strongest
showing for Islamist parties in parliamentary elections since 1989.[11] Etaf
Roudan, a Jordanian journalist, stated that the IAF's political position on
the Palestinian issue had pushed leftists, traditional nationalists, and
tribal forces to vote for the Islamic party.[7]

This stance was reflected by Murad al-Adaileh, general secretary of the IAF,
who said that the election results showed "The next House of Representatives
must be robust in confronting the extreme Israeli right, which may, in the
future, align with the extreme American right if Trump wins the US
elections."[7] _France 24_ reported that the "nearly half a million votes" the
IAF won was "unprecedented in their history in Jordan."[12] Adaileh also
claimed that the election results were a "popular referendum" for Jordan to
scrap the Israel–Jordan peace treaty, and to back Hamas.[13]

On 15 September, Bisher Khasawneh resigned as prime minister. In response,
King Abdullah nominated his chief of staff, Jafar Hassan, to form a new
government.[14]
