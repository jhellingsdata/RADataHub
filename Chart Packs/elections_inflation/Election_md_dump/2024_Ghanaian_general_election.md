General elections will be held in Ghana on 7 December 2024 to elect the
president and members of Parliament.[1][2] Incumbent President Nana Akufo-Addo
is term-limited and ineligible to run again.

## Electoral system

[edit]

The President of Ghana is elected using the two-round system.The 275 members
of Parliament are elected in single-member constituencies using first-past-
the-post voting.[3][4]

Eligible voters must be Ghanaian citizens at least 18 years old, although
those declared insane are disenfranchised. Parliamentary candidates must be
Ghanaian citizens at least 21 years old, be residents of a constituency, or
have lived there for at least five of the ten years prior to the election.[5]

## Primary elections

[edit]

### New Patriotic Party

[edit]

The ruling New Patriotic Party opened its nomination period on 26 May 2023,
and closed nominations on 24 June 2023. It selected its candidate at its
National Congress on 4 November 2023.[6] More than five candidates filed to
run in the primaries; the party called for a Special Congress on 26 August.
Incumbent President Akufo-Addo said that members of his cabinet who sought to
run for president should step down from their posts to focus on their
campaigns, prompting a number of resignations.[7][8]

#### Presidential candidates

[edit]

**Nominee**

  * **Mahamudu Bawumia** , incumbent Vice-President of Ghana[9][10]

**Eliminated in primary**

  * Francis Addai-Nimoh, former Member of Parliament for Mampong
  * Owusu Afriyie Akoto, immediate former Minister for Food and Agriculture[11]
  * Kennedy Agyapong, Member of Parliament for Assin Central[9]
  * Kwabena Agyapong, former Presidential Press Secretary and General Secretary of the New Patriotic Party[9]
  * Boakye Agyarko, immediate former Minister for Energy and Petroleum[9]
  * Joe Ghartey, former Attorney General[9]
  * Kofi Konadu Apraku, former Minister for Regional Cooperation
  * Alan Kyeremanten, immediate former Minister for Trade and Industry[9]
  * Kwadwo Poku, businessman[12]

#### Results

[edit]

To reduce the number of candidates, the NPP held a Special Super Delegates
Congress on 26 August 2023, which would select the top five candidates who
would then go on to contest the final primary in November. Vice President
Bawumia placed first, with 68% of the vote. To the surprise of many observers,
"maverick" MP Kennedy Agyapong, running a campaign largely critical of the
Akufo-Addo administration, placed second, edging out NPP veteran Alan
Kyeremanten, who first ran for President in 2008. Owusu Afriyie Akoto placed
fourth, while Francis Addai-Nimoh and Boakye Agyarko tied for fifth place,
necessitating a run-off, which Addai-Nimoh won, rounding out the five final
candidates for the primary.[13] However, Kyeremanten announced that he would
withdraw from the primary (later leaving the NPP entirely and launching his
own third-party campaign), leaving four candidates.[14]

Candidate| Votes| %  
---|---|---  
Mahamudu Bawumia| 629| 68.37  
Kennedy Agyapong| 132| 14.35  
Alan Kyeremanten| 95| 10.33  
Owusu Afriyie Akoto| 36| 3.91  
Francis Addai-Nimoh| 9| 0.98  
Boakye Agyarko| 9| 0.98  
Kwabena Agyapong| 6| 0.65  
Kwadwo Poku| 4| 0.43  
Kofi Konadu Apraku| 0| 0.00  
Total| 920| 100.00  
  
The NPP held its primary on 4 November 2023. Bawumia again won by a wide
margin, confirming him as the NPP's nominee for the 2024 elections, although
Agyapong placed in an ever stronger second relative to his performance in the
Super Delegates' Congress.[15]

Candidate| Votes| %  
---|---|---  
Mahamudu Bawumia| 118,210| 61.43  
Kennedy Agyapong| 71,991| 37.41  
Owusu Afriyie Akoto| 1,459| 0.76  
Francis Addai-Nimoh| 781| 0.41  
Total| 192,441| 100.00  
  
#### Parliamentary candidates

New Patriotic Party

### National Democratic Congress

[edit]

The opposition National Democratic Congress opened its nomination period on 22
February 2023 and closed nominations on 22 March 2023. Candidates were
required to pay a GH₵500,000 filing fee and a GH₵30,000 nomination fee, women
and persons living with disabilities were eligible for a 50% discount. The NDC
selected its candidate on 13 May 2023.[16]

#### Presidential candidates

[edit]

**Nominee**

  * **John Mahama** , former President of Ghana (2012–2017)[17]

**Eliminated in primary**

  * Kojo Bonsu, former mayor of Kumasi[17]
  * Kwabena Duffuor, former governor of the Bank of Ghana and Minister for Finance and Economic Planning[17]
  * Ernest Kobeah, businessman[17]

#### Results

[edit]

The NDC primary was held on 13 May 2023. Kobeah dropped out on 29 March and
Duffuor dropped out the day before the election, claiming irregularities in
the organization of the polls, leaving two candidates.[18][19] Former
President Mahama won nomination in an overwhelming landslide, winning nearly
99% of the vote, setting the stage for the fourth consecutive election in
which he would be the NDC's flag-bearer.[20] Bonsu called Mahama to concede
and offer his support.[21]

Candidate| Votes| %  
---|---|---  
John Mahama| 297,603| 98.94  
Kojo Bonsu| 3,181| 1.06  
Total| 300,784| 100.00  
  
In June 2024, the NDC accused the electoral commission of colluding with the
ruling NPP to rig the elections via an illegal voter transfer scheme, which
the NDC claimed was orchestrated by Yohane Amarh Ashitey, the NPP
Parliamentary Candidate and the Tema Metropolitan Chief Executive.[22]

### Other parties

[edit]

#### Movement For Change

[edit]

On 25 September 2023, Alan John Kyeremanten formed the Movement For Change
party to aspire for the 2024 Ghanaian general election as an independent
presidential candidate for the presidential race after resigning from New
Patriotic Party (NPP). Therefore he will be a presidential candidate for the
2024 Ghanaian general election.[23][24]

#### The New Force

[edit]

On 7 January 2024, real estate developer Nana Kwame Bediako announced that he
would run as the candidate for the New Force movement. This followed weeks of
speculation during which the New Force teased its fielding of a "masked"
candidate, who was widely expected to be Bediako. The announcement, which was
due to take place at Black Star Square, was postponed after the presidential
administration pulled the permit for the rally, citing a "an unforeseen state
event".[25]

### **Ghana Freedom Party**

[edit]

Akua Donkor's Ghana Freedom Party, having being disqualified in the 2012
Ghanaian general election and 2016 Ghanaian general election and contesting in
the 2020 Ghanaian general election submitted their form on September 12 to
officially contest in the 2024 Ghanaian general election. However, on
September 28, it was announced that the party's founder and flag bearer had
passed on,[26][27] leaving a controversial void as to the way forward with the
Electoral Commission of Ghana halting ballot printing.[28]

On November 4, the party's leadership announced the nomination of Kwabena
Agyeman Appiah Kubi popularly known as _Roman Fada_ as its new presidential
candidate.[29][30]

nominations on Friday 13 September 2024, 24 of the candidates had successfully
filed their nomination papers with the Commission.[35] 12 candidates submitted
forms as representatives of political parties and the other 12 were
independent candidates. Two candidates submitted their forms after the

**^a** – Disqualified by the Electoral Commission of Ghana

## Final list of presidential candidates for the 2024 election

[edit]

On 20 September 2024, the Electoral Commission released the final list of
candidates who would be on the ballot for the presidential election. 13 of the
24 applicants made the final list while 11 were disqualifed.[48] The
disqualifications were based on the candidates not having fulfilled all the
requirements or discrepancies noticed on their forms.[49] 9 of the 12
candidates of political parties and 4 of the 12 independent candidates made
the final list. Candidates of the People's National Convention (PNC),
Progressive Alliance for Ghana (PAG) and the Progressive People's Party (PPP)
were not listed.[50] The order of candidates on the ballot paper was
determined by a ballot conducted by the Electoral Commission on 20 September
2024.[51][52] On 28 October 2024, Akua Donkor, the presidential candidate for
the Ghana Freedom Party died after being suddenly falling ill.[53][54]
