Malta_local_elections_2024.svg.png)The colours of the map indicate the party
that achieved control of the council, but not necessarily a plurality or
majority of votes.  
  
**Local council elections** were held in Malta and Gozo on 8 June 2024, in
tandem with the European Parliament elections.[1] This is the second time that
all local councils of Malta shall be elected simultaneously in a single
election, following the 2015 reform abolishing the previous system of half-
council elections.[2]

## Background

[edit]

### Previous election

[edit]

The Labour Party won an absolute majority of 268 local council seats and 48
mayoralties in the 2019 local elections, swiping control of several village
councils from the Nationalist Party in a wave of electoral successes for said
PL, most significant of all being the flip of Siġġiewi from PN to PL.[3] Since
the 2019 election, a firm Labour bloc in the central-south regions of Malta
can be found.[4]

Only _two_ independents were elected in two councils in Malta and Gozo. Steven
Zammit Lupi was elected to the Żebbuġ local council in Malta,[5] and Nicky
Saliba, ex-PN mayor of Żebbuġ in Gozo, was elected as an independent and
managed to deadlock the council there, finally resulting in his re-election as
mayor.[6] Malta uses the single transferable vote system in all elections.

#### Party developments

[edit]

Several parties have been founded since 2019.

Floriana First (Maltese: _Floriana I-Ewwel_), and Għarb First (Maltese: _Għarb
l-Ewwel_), both unrelated localist parties, were registered immediately after
the election having previously participated as _ad hoc_ groups. The leaders
are Nigel Holland and David Apap Agius respectively.

The People's Party (Maltese: _Partit Popolari_), a right-wing conservative
anti-immigration party, was founded sometime around the summer of 2021 by Mr.
Paul Salomone, starting the registration process with the Electoral Commission
in June.[7] It held its first founding press conference in November 2020.[8]
It is considered to have replaced the since-2020 inactive Moviment Patrijotti
Maltin even if they are unrelated.

Alleanza Bidla (which is still registered with the Electoral Commission) de
facto reformed as ABBA party by AB leader Ivan Grech Mintoff, nephew of ex-
Prime Minister Dominic Mintoff. ABBA party is a right-wing, Christian party
which is closely associated by Protestant-Pentecostalist evangelical movement
River of Love.[9][10]

The Democratic Alternative, and Marlene Farrugia's Democratic Party, performed
abysmally in the previous election, with AD garnering only 1977 first-
preference votes (0.77%) around Malta and Gozo and losing its only local
council seat in Attard held by party secretary Ralph Cassar, and PD garnering
only 555 first-preference votes (0.21%), gaining no seats. Both parties would
merge under the new name 'AD+PD' (pronounced and frequently rendered _ADPD_),
retaining Carmel Cacopardo as chairman of the party and Ralph Cassar as
secretarv-general.[11][12] AD+PD's current chairwoman is Sandra Gauci since
her election on 27 May 2023.[13]

### Eligibility to vote

[edit]

The Electoral Commission of Malta is obliged to update and publish an
electoral register in every election. The ECM published said electoral
register on 31 March 2023. Voting age is 16 for all elections in Malta.
Maltese, and UK-nationals that satisfy the voting age and necessary residency
requirements are eligible to vote in these local council elections.[14]

### Events, issues, criticism and proposals throughout the five-year term

[edit]

Since and before 2019, there has been much criticism by the Nationalist
opposition and civil society groups that Malta and Gozo local council's powers
have, under a Labour Party administration, been watered down and concentrated
more on Castille.[15] A year before, the National Audit Office expressed its
anger at an "alarming situation" where fifteen local councils and one regional
council failed to submit their audited financial statements in November
2022.[16]

On 8 August 2023, Ministry for Local Government launched a "national strategic
vision" for Local Councils and government in Malta and Gozo. This would aim to
strengthen the role of Police and the environment locally.[17]

#### Changes to Local Government Act lowering the minimum age required for
councillors to serve as mayors

[edit]

On 11 October 2023, the Minister for Local Government Owen Bonniċi and
Parliamentary Secretary Alison Żerafa Civelli unveiled a legislative process
through a bill amending the Local Government Act permitting 16-17 year olds to
be elected as mayors and deputy mayors of the Maltese local councils.[18] It
was approved by Cabinet on the same day.[19] This was however not approved by
an overwhelming majority of the Maltese population, and was very much derided
on social media. A Times of Malta poll found that 97% of responders did not
agree with the draft legislation.[20] The idea was not really conceived by PL,
as PN had proposed the exact same in a December manifesto on local government
published by the party in December 2022.[21][22]

If these plans are put to effect, Malta would be the first country in the EU
(and the European continent) to lower the minimum age required to serve as
mayor.[23]

#### Garbage problem in various localities

[edit]

Garbage collection in various localities around Malta and Gozo has been an
issue. Some mayors such as Swieqi's Noel Muscat and Sliema's John Pillow
decried an "uncontrollable" and "unbearable" garbage problem with the latter
even resorting to naming and shaming.[24][25] The Nationalist Party had also
stated in a press conference that "councils are being faced by “immense
pressure” without having any control over the situation, which is in turn
affecting the country's reputation". Nationalist MP Eve Borg Bonello posted a
Facebook video calling Minister for the Environment, Energy and Enterprise
Miriam Dalli a "pseudo green warrior who recently faced a national
embarrassment".[_relevant?_][26]

On 4 September 2023, Labour Party television channel ONE TV claimed through an
"exclusive report" to have revealed a private recording of a voice message
sent by Pillow to a Sliema resident in the advent of a Nationalist Party press
conference one the same subject, where according to ONE, Pillow claimed he
left garbage uncollected on purpose to show journalists the state of his town
to the media in the press conference.[27] Pillow rebutted the report as
manipulative, calling it out as a "heinous lie" in a Facebook post, playing in
public the concerned voice message recording in full.[28][29]

#### Over development

[edit]

Several mayors, local councils, and even minority opposition within councils
without the support of said council have protested and objected several
development projects around Malta and Gozo.

One of the most notable cases was the blocking of a development in Gżira where
Labour Party Mayor Conrad Borg Manché and the Gżira Local Council won an
appeal case against the Lands Authority which granted back to the Council
jurisdiction and control of the Yacht Marina Garden, as opposed to allowing
the Authority to proceed with plans to relocate the petrol station to the
garden.[30] On 8 October 2023, Borg Manché would resign from the Labour Party,
claiming the party departured from its socialist principles. "The party is no
longer a socialist party that fights for workers. That is why I had joined the
party in the first place, and so this resignation is only natural.", he
said.[31][32][33][34]

In March 2023, a landmark ruling in Santa Luċija, Malta by Chief Judge Mark
Chetcuti cancelled an Environment and Review Tribunal permit that proposed a
5-storey development which would have ruined the uniformity of a street
containing only 2-storey houses. It is good to note that the Planning
Authority had not approved this development proposal, and was only approved by
the EPRT after an appeal lodged by the applicant. This appeal was again
contested by Nationalist minority leader in the S. Luċija Local Council, Liam
Sciberras and resident Michael Pule. In this case, the minority leader
criticised Labour Party Mayor Charmaine St John and Vice-Mayor Frederick
Cutajar who according to Sciberras, defended the developer instead of the
resident objectors.[35] The Local Council, at first however, did object to the
project.[36] The People's Party, in a statement also expressed its solidarity
with both the residents and the local council of Santa Luċija.[37]

Another similar case is a 20-year battle against a Ħondoq ir-Rummien
"megaproject" ended also successfully for the local populace and Qala mayor
Paul Buttiġieġ. "The proposed project, with a total site area of over 103,000
square metres, was divided into several zones. It included a 110-bedroom hotel
set on nine floors, 25 self-catering villas, 60 self-catering apartments, 200
multi-ownership residential units consisting of apartments, maisonettes and
bungalows, over 1,200 underground car-parking spaces, a chapel, administration
offices, shops and restaurants."[38]

In the Nigret area of Żurrieq, farmland is slated to become a residential area
despite several objections.[39] Activism in this village has been particularly
active, with the formation of the _Għaqda Residenti taż-Żurrieq_ (English:
Żurrieq Residents Group) as a local pressure group protesting and raising
funds to challenge this development.[40] They eventually managed to raise
enough money in August 2022 to take the Planning Authority to the courts over
these plans, after the PA executive council also voted unanimously to allow
procedure anyway of the developments.[41]

The Rabat (Malta) Local Council also objected to the construction of a
farmhouse in the 'Għeriexem Valley' area. The primary reasons for this
objection are that Wied Għeriexem is a buffer zone between Rabat and Mdina and
that a permitted precedent might permit more developments in that area and
that the finished building will not be able to be used for residential
purposes, something that the law requires it to prove.[42][43] The People's
Party also released a statement supporting the local council and the Rabat
residents, however also proposing that 'outside development zones' or ODZs be
granted constitutional protection, meaning that construction in these areas
would be constrained by a 2/3 vote in Parliament or in a referendum.[44]

#### Instances of electoral fraud

[edit]

##### Pre-election

[edit]

Maltese courts on 24 May 2024 annulled the ID card residence registration of
99 'ghost voters' who illegally changed such voter registration address to
unfinished and uninhabitable flat addresses in Siġġiewi following a successful
lawsuit per illegaly registered voter by the Nationalist Party in
opposition.[45] The legal battle involved 22 magistrates and took three weeks.
This led to housing minister Roderick Galdes being disparagingly titled
'Electoral Fraud Minister' by Opposition-affiliated media _NET_.[46] This
heavily implicates that the Labour Party stood to benefit from such voter
address registration changes with also a win for said Labour Party further
consolidated as such.[47]

###### Voting cards issued to deceased voters

[edit]

Ex-ABBA leader Ivan Grech Mintoff alleged in a debate on Maltese national
broadcaster Television Malta that a voter who has been dead for two years has
been issued a voting card for the 2024 election, stating "_F'din l-elezzjoni
ħa jerġgħu jivvotaw il-mejtin_ " (English: In this election, dead people are
going to vote again). Newsbook confirmed said deceased voter's identity and
document and stated that such cases were not isolated. The Electoral
Commission did not answer questions sent by Newsbook on these
concerns.[48][_additional citation(s) needed_]

Similarly in August 2023, a whistleblower made claims that deceased people's
identities were used to vote for the Labour Party in the 2022 general
election.[49]

## Participating parties

[edit]

From September 2023, the Nationalist Party confirmed with Newsbook that it has
approved 170 candidates for these elections. The Labour Party did not answer a
similar question posed by Newsbook, while AD+PD and Volt confirmed that they
will be participating in the election, but were not in the situation to
provide information.[51] In October 2023 the PN said that they have more than
200 candidates.[_citation needed_] PP and ABBA were not asked.

On 29 April 2024, with the closing of the nomination period for candidates,
the Electoral Commission[52] announced that the Labour Party would be fielding
381 candidates (down 19 from last election), the Nationalist Party would be
fielding 293 candidates (down 4), AD+PD 7 candidates (down from 16 in 2019),
and the People's Party 4 candidates. Residenti Beltin (English: _Valletta
Residents_) and Floriana First (down 1) shall each field a candidate, and 19
independent candidates (up from 12) shall contest seats. Volt Malta failed to
follow in its plan to contest these elections and did not field any
candidates. ABBA party did not field candidates nor express any intent to
contest these elections.

Parties in this table are in order of representation, then with number of
candidates, with independents last.
