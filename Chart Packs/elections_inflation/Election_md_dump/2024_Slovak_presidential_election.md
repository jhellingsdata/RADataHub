Presidential elections were held in Slovakia in March and April 2024.
Incumbent president Zuzana Čaputová announced in June 2023 that she would not
run for a second term.[1]

In the first round held on 23 March, Ivan Korčok led with 43% of the votes
followed by Peter Pellegrini with 37%. As no candidate received a majority, a
runoff was scheduled between the two on 6 April.[2][3] However, in the second
round, Pellegrini defeated Korčok with 53% of the vote. He was sworn in as
president on 15 June.[4]

The election was widely regarded as a win for Slovakia's prime minister Robert
Fico who saw his ally elected as President.

## Electoral system

[edit]

The President of Slovakia is elected using the two-round system; if no
candidate gains a majority in the first round, a runoff will be held between
the top-two candidates.[5]

## Candidates

[edit]

### Eligibility

Milan Náhlik, Štefan Harabin, Marian Kotleba and Peter Pellegrini have
expressed statements sympathetic with Russia in relation to its invasion of
Ukraine and critical of the European Union, with Pellegrini supporting Ukraine
opening negotiations with Russia. Meanwhile, Ivan Korčok has been supportive
of the West and Ukrainian resistance against Russia.[16] During the campaign,
Pellegrini accused Korčok of being a warmonger who wants to send troops to
Ukraine, which Korčok denied.[17] Pellegrini also said that he was running for
president "to rescue the government of [Prime Minister] Robert Fico." Fico
also openly supported Pellegrini, calling him a “a moderate candidate who
recognises the value of peace" and described Korčok as supporting "everything
the West tells him without hesitation".[18] Pellegrini and Fico's accusations
were made despite the office of the president not having constitutional powers
to deploy military forces abroad.[19]

Korčok ran on the notion of "not letting Robert Fico take everything"

Following the results of the first round, Korčok said that he acknowledged a
"need to reach out more to voters who supported the government parties,”
adding that it was also clear that “they’re not satisfied with how this
government is ruling, where it’s taking Slovakia.” Pellegrini congratulated
Korčok for his first place and pledged to hold “several duels, as it should
be” with Korčok before the second round, and “not to succumb” to an aggressive
campaign style, having only engaged once in a debate prior to the first round
of voting. He also noted that a majority of voters voted for nationalist
candidates and not "a liberal, progressive" candidate, and predicted the
second round of voting to be a tight race.[20][21][22]

President Čaputová denounced war rhetoric used during the campaigning for the
second round and defended both Pellegrini and Korčok from allegations that
they were willing to deploy soldiers in Ukraine.[23]

## Aftermath

[edit]

Following the results, Pellegrini pledged to be "a president of all Slovak
citizens" and "be always by the side of Slovakia." Korčok conceded defeat and
congratulated Pellegrini, while acknowledging that he was "disappointed" by
the electoral result.[34]

Pellegrini's victory is seen by analysts to be a gain for the government of
Prime Minister Robert Fico, with Pellegrini having been acquiescent in Fico's
efforts to overhaul the justice system, which had launched investigations into
members of Fico's SMER party and place public broadcasting under state
control, in addition to sharing his views on Ukraine and relations with
Russia.[19]
