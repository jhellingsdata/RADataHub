The **2024 Queensland state election** was held on 26 October 2024 to elect
all members to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland pursuant to the
_Constitution (Fixed Term Parliament) Amendment Act 2015_. As a result of the
2016 Queensland term length referendum, the term of the parliament will run
for four years.[1][2]

The election was the first since 2006 to feature two men leading the major
parties. The opposition Liberal National Party (LNP) led by David Crisafulli
defeated the incumbent Labor government, led by Premier Steven Miles after
three terms in government.[3] Katter's Australian Party and the Queensland
Greens also held seats in parliament, while other parties that contested the
election included Pauline Hanson's One Nation, Legalise Cannabis
Queensland,[4] other minor parties as well as independents.

The LNP's victory was not clear until late on the night of the election count,
when analysts projected Labor had lost their majority and the LNP was on track
to form a majority government.[5] Crisafulli declared victory in a late-night
speech following the close of polls, however Miles initially held back on
conceding pending further counting in several seats, though by the following
morning he conceded defeat at a press conference.[6][7]

The LNP has currently won 51 seats in the assembly (enough for a five-seat
majority), with a positive swing of approximately six percentage points on
first-preference (primary) votes translating into a net 15-seat gain. Labor by
contrast has had a swing against them of almost seven percent, losing a net 16
seats and currently leaving them on 35 seats. Katter's Australian Party (KAP)
retained three of their seats, though former One Nation MP Stephen Andrew, who
joined KAP six weeks prior to the election and boosted the party's seat figure
in parliament to four, lost the seat of Mirani to the LNP. The Greens were
targeting victories in multiple seats throughout metropolitan Brisbane after
strong performances at the 2022 federal election,[8] though their primary vote
stagnated and the party's representation in parliament was halved, winning
only one seat (Maiwar). Independent Sandy Bolton has retained the seat of
Noosa; according to the ABC, only the seat of Mulgrave remains in doubt.[9]

Crisafulli was sworn in as Queensland's 41st Premier by Governor Jeannette
Young on 28 October, alongside his deputy Jarrod Bleijie.[10] The pair formed
an interim ministry, with the full ministry sworn in later in the week.[11]

## Electoral system

[edit]

Queensland has compulsory voting and uses full-preference preferential voting
for single-member electorates. The election is conducted by the Electoral
Commission of Queensland. The party or coalition that wins the majority of
seats (at least 47) forms the government. If no majority emerges, then the
party or coalition that is able to command the confidence of the Legislative
Assembly forms government as a minority government.

The party or coalition that wins the second-highest number of seats forms the
opposition, with the remaining parties and independent candidates being
allocated to the cross bench.

The Queensland Parliament is the only unicameral state parliament in
Australia, composed of the Legislative Assembly. The upper house, the
Legislative Council, was abolished in 1922.

## Key dates

[edit]

The election will be for all 93 members of the Legislative Assembly. Pursuant
to _Constitution (Fixed Term Parliament) Amendment Act 2015_ Queensland has
fixed terms, with all elections following the 2020 election held every four
years on the last Saturday of October.[12] The Governor may call an election
earlier than scheduled if the Government does not maintain confidence, or the
annual appropriation bill fails to pass.

  * Issue of election writ – Tuesday 1 October 2024, by the Governor of Queensland.
  * Candidate nominations period – Wednesday 2 October to Tuesday 8 October 2024 at 12pm, local time.
  * Ballot paper order draw – Tuesday 8 October 2024 at 2.30pm.
  * Early voting period – Monday 14 October to Friday 25 October 2024 from 8am–6pm (excluding the weekend).
  * Postal vote applications close – Monday 14 October 2024 at 7pm.
  * Election Day – Saturday 26 October 2024 (from 8am–6pm).
  * Postal vote return deadline – Tuesday 5 November 2024.[13]

## Background

[edit]

After suffering a landslide defeat at the 2012 state election, the Labor Party
achieved a 37-seat swing and returned to power in Queensland at the 2015 state
election under the leadership of Annastacia Palaszczuk. Initially forming a
minority government, they later won a majority at the 2017 state election, and
further increased their number of seats in 2020 at an election overshadowed by
the COVID-19 pandemic. Palaszczuk resigned as Premier in December 2023 and was
succeeded by her deputy, Steven Miles.[14] On 16 March 2024, the first
elections during his leadership, two by-elections, were held in Inala and
Ipswich West.[15] Despite being held by safe margins of 28.2% and 14.3%
respectively, a massive swing against the Labor party was recorded in both
seats, resulting in the margin in Inala being cut by more than 20%, and the
loss of Ipswich West to the LNP.[16]

## Registered parties

[edit]

The following parties are registered with Queensland Electoral Commission:[17]

  * Australian Labor Party (State of Queensland)
  * Liberal National Party of Queensland
  * Katter's Australian Party (KAP)
  * Queensland Greens
  * Animal Justice Party (Queensland)
  * Family First Queensland
  * Legalise Cannabis Queensland (Party)
  * Libertarian Party of Queensland
  * Pauline Hanson's One Nation Queensland Division

## Campaign

[edit]

The LNP campaigned heavily on four key issues, which it has labelled as
crises: crime (particularly youth crime), cost-of-living, housing
affordability and health. Crisafulli credited Labor's poor results at by-
elections, held in March 2024, with voters' anger over Labor's handling of
those key issues.[18] After what Miles described as a "very bad result" for
Labor at the two state by-elections, he accused the LNP of "sensationalising
and politicising" crime to win votes.[19]

Opinion polling and betting odds had the LNP as the firm favourites to win the
election in a landslide, with Miles himself conceding that it was "very
likely" that Labor would lose the election, whilst also criticising
Crisafulli's "small target strategy" and claiming he had a lack of plans
despite likely becoming the state's next Premier.[20] An opinion poll
conducted by YouGov and released on 26 April 2024 saw Labor record a two-
party-preferred vote of just 44%, while Miles had a net negative approval
rating of –22%, marking the worst opinion poll result for a Queensland Premier
in 20 years.[21]

In August 2024, Miles announced a policy of state-owned petrol
stations,[22][23][24] while Crisafulli promised to re-introduce optional
preferential voting, which was previously used in Queensland from 1992 to
2015, and is currently used at a state level in New South Wales and
Tasmania.[25]

The lack of affordable rentals, and rent increases emerged as a major issue
over the campaign. In Brisbane, median advertised rents increased by 49 per
cent from the start of the COVID pandemic to December 2023.[26]

On 26 September Miles suggested Labor would consider introducing a cap of 10%
on the amount rent can increase each year.[27] Miles subsequently came under
pressure by property industry lobbyists to rule out the policy, with
Queensland Greens MP, Amy MacMahon commenting “Make no mistake, the only
reason Labor is finally considering something they've opposed for years is
because they're under massive pressure from the Greens this election,”.[28]
Support for rent caps was expressed by social housing peak body Queensland
Shelter.

A YouGov poll commissioned by the Queensland Greens published by _Seven News_
on 2 October and _the Courier Mail_ 3 October indicated 54% of Queenslanders
polled supported rent increases being capped at 1% annually. With support by
Labor voters at 60%, 44% of LNP voters, and 70% of Greens voters.[29]

A leaders debate was held on the 3rd of October broadcast by Channel 9, 4BC
radio and the Brisbane Times.[30] An online reader poll with 64,000 votes
conducted by the Brisbane Times declared opposition Leader David Crisafulli
won the debate with 57% of the vote.[31]

Miles and Crisafulli ruled out introducing a rent cap during the leaders
debate.[32]

In 2 October 2024, Labor's Miles announced a policy of a state-owned energy
retailer.[33][34] On 13 October 2024, Labor announced a policy of Free school
meals.[35]

A second leaders debate between the LNP and ALP leaders was held on the 16th
of October.

A final leaders debate between the ALP and LNP leaders was hosted by Sky News
and The Courier-Mail People’s Forum on October 22.[36] The debate consisted of
100 undecided voters picked by YouGov, who would then be chosen to ask
questions to the leaders. The results of the debate are as follows: 39% Miles,
35% Crisafulli, and 26% still undecided.[37]

### Controversy

[edit]

Certain individual candidates attracted controversy during the course of the
campaign, in particular for insensitivity regarding Nazi
symbolism.[38][39][40]

## Candidates

[edit]

Main article: Candidates of the 2024 Queensland state election

A total of 525 candidates from nine political parties (or independent) will
contest the election. It is the second-most contested election by nominated
candidates in Queensland history, behind the previous election (2020).[42][43]

Crisafulli began announcing LNP candidates 18 months prior to the election,
making the LNP the first party to formally endorse candidates for the
election.[44] The LNP announced several other candidates afterwards. The
second party to formally endorse a candidate was Katter's Australian Party
(KAP), announcing their candidate for the Far North Queensland seat of Cook on
6 October 2023.[45]

Labor, the LNP, and the Greens have announced candidates in all 93
electorates.[46] Pauline Hanson announced 2 October her One Nation Party would
also be contesting every seat.[47]

### Preferences

[edit]

Candidates and parties may publish recommendations to voters on How-to-vote
cards and other materials indicating how that candidate or party suggests a
voter should order their ballot under the state's full-preference instant-
runoff voting system. Voters must number every candidate on the ballot paper
to cast a formal vote. A candidate or party cannot determine the order a vote
is distributed for a voter. Preference deals refer to parties or candidates
agreeing to order recommendations on each other's how-to-vote materials that
are favourable to the other.

#### Liberal National

[edit]

In late 2023, it was reported in _The Australian_ that Leader of the
Opposition David Crisafulli considered preferencing the Greens over Labor at
the upcoming state election.[48] Crisafulli told the newspaper: "Now, the same
doesn't happen on the other side of the draw – the preferences on the right
don't flow in the same way that the Greens' preferences flow to Labor,"
adding: "So it is a corrupt system... and I have a big concern about the
prospect of a Labor–Greens coalition. They will say no deals... but they've
said that before and they then broke the promise anyway. So I am deeply
concerned by that."[48]

On 1 October 2024, the LNP officially announced they would preference Labor
over the Greens at the state election.[49]

#### One Nation

[edit]

One Nation leader and federal Senator for Queensland, Pauline Hanson,
confirmed in February 2024 that One Nation would preference the LNP over Labor
in every seat, despite her reported distrust of both major parties.[50]

#### Labor

[edit]

Retiring Labor MP and Attorney-General Yvette D’Ath claimed on 24 August the
that the Greens were "happy to do deals" with the LNP to get more members
elected to parliament. While Ms D'Ath issued a plea to voters to not replace
Labor MPs with Greens members, she refused to concede that the polling showed
a progressive swing among inner-city residents.[51]

Labor is giving preferences to Legalise Cannabis ahead of the Greens in 28
seats.[52]

#### Greens

[edit]

The Queensland Greens had previously ruled out doing any preference deal with
the LNP in 2024.[53]

#### Katter

[edit]

The Katter's Australian Party will give its preference to the LNP in North
Queensland seats.[54]

## Retiring members

## Opinion polling

In the lead-up to the state election, polling companies conduct regular
opinion polls for various news organisations. These polls collect data on
parties' primary vote, and contain an estimation of the two-party-preferred
vote. They also ask questions about the electorates' views on major party
leaders.

Some polls do not publish a two-party-preferred result. In these cases, the
result has been manually calculated from preference flows at the 2020
election.
