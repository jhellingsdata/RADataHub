## Issues

See also: 2024 United States presidential election § Campaign issues

### Economic issues

Main article: Economy of the United States

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Inflation_2018-2024_US_vs._EuroZone.png/200px-
Inflation_2018-2024_US_vs._EuroZone.png)Post-COVID inflation spike in the US,
with the gray column indicating the COVID-19 recession in US

Voters consistently cited the economy as their top issue in the 2024
election.[1] Following the COVID-19 pandemic, a global surge in inflation
ensued that raised prices on many goods, though the U.S. inflation rate had
declined significantly during 2023 and 2024.[2][3][4] _The New York Times_
reported that both candidates "embraced a vision of a powerful federal
government, using its muscle to intervene in markets in pursuit of a stronger
and more prosperous economy."[5]

### Election interference

Main article: Foreign interference in the 2024 United States elections

Domestic Pro-Israel groups have spent large sums of money to support pro-
Israel candidates against candidates critical of the Israeli government.[6][7]
According to a campaign finance analysis by _Politico_ , AIPAC is the "biggest
source of Republican money flowing into competitive Democratic primaries this
year."[8]

Several foreign nations may have interfered in the 2024 United States
elections, the most notable being China, Iran, and Russia. The efforts have
largely focused on propaganda and disinformation campaigns using inauthentic
accounts on social media, and stoking domestic divisions and denigrating the
United States and democracy more broadly.[9][10][11]

### Abortion

This was the first presidential election held after the overturn of _Roe v.
Wade_ , and the third overall election cycle after the 2022 midterm elections
and the 2023 off-year elections. Republican-controlled states predominantly
passed near-total bans on abortion in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's
June 2022 _Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization_ decision. By April
2023, abortion was "largely illegal" in several states.[12] According to the
Kaiser Family Foundation, there were 15 states that had _de jure_ early stage
bans on abortion explicitly without exceptions for rape or incest: Alabama,
Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio,
Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.[12]
(Ohio voters subsequently codified abortion rights in Ohio's state
constitution via November 2023 Ohio Issue 1.) In states with laws granting
exceptions, it was reported _de facto_ that "very few exceptions to these new
abortion bans have been granted" and that patients who had been raped or
otherwise qualified for exceptions were being turned away, citing "ambiguous
laws and the threat of criminal penalties make them unwilling to test the
rules".[13]

Democrats outperformed Biden's results in the 2020 U.S. presidential election
in several 2022 House special elections, with abortion cited as a major
contributor to their victories.[14] Then during the 2023 elections, both
Democratic and Republican operatives attributed the Democrats' overperformance
streak to the growing bipartisan support of broad abortion rights in the wake
of _Dobbs_ decision.[15][16] Thus, many conservative political analysts and
commentators called a continued Republican alliance with the anti-abortion
movement "untenable" and an "electoral disaster", and urged the party to favor
abortion rights.[17] Some issue polling has shown Donald Trump, the 2024
Presidential Republican nominee, outrunning his party and closing the gap with
Democrats on the issue of abortion, but no election data with Trump directly
on the ballot has happened to verify these results.[18]

Mark Robinson, who once advocated for a complete abortion ban without
exceptions, underwent a rhetorical shift in his North Carolina gubernatorial
campaign. In 2018, he had labeled abortion as "murder" and "genocide," but as
the leading Republican candidate for governor of North Carolina in 2024, he
avoided mentioning abortion on the campaign trail. However, his stance
softened following the Supreme Court's 2022 Dobbs decision and the passage of
North Carolina's 12-week abortion ban in May 2023. Robinson, who had shifted
to emphasizing the term "life" instead of "abortion," expressed support for
"heartbeat" legislation with exceptions for rape, incest, and the mother's
life. Despite his past harsh rhetoric, Robinson's then-current position
reflected a more nuanced approach to anti-abortion legislation.[19]

Abortion referendums were on the ballot in 10 states in 2024: Arizona,
Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York and
South Dakota.[20]

### Indictments

a-Lago.jpg/220px-Classified_intelligence_material_found_during_search_of_Mar-
a-Lago.jpg)Classified intelligence material found inside Mar-a-Lago

On November 18, 2022, three days after former president and Republican
candidate Donald Trump announced his 2024 re-election bid, U.S. Attorney
General Merrick Garland appointed Jack Smith as special counsel to investigate
Trump's role in the January 6th U.S. Capitol attack and Trump's mishandling of
government documents, including classified documents.

On March 30, 2023, Trump was indicted by a grand jury in Manhattan for his
alleged role in a scandal stemming from hush money payments made to Stormy
Daniels before the 2016 presidential election.[21]

On May 10, 2023, Republican New York Congressman George Santos was indicted on
federal charges of fraud and money laundering.[22]

On June 8, 2023, Trump was indicted on 37 federal charges related to his
alleged mishandling of classified documents by the office of the Smith special
counsel investigation.[23]

On August 1, 2023, a Washington, D.C., federal grand jury indicted Trump again
on four felony counts of conspiracy and obstruction related to Trump's role in
the January 6 attack and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.[24]

On August 14, a Georgia grand jury indicted Trump on racketeering and other
felonies committed in an effort to overturn the state's 2020 election results
and the Trump–Raffensperger phone call.[25][26] As of September 15, 2023,
Trump has pleaded not guilty to all the charges.

On August 11, four months after incumbent president and Democratic candidate
Joe Biden announced his re-election bid, Garland appointed David C. Weiss to
serve as special counsel to investigate Biden's son, Hunter Biden, who was
indicted on September 14, 2023, on three federal firearms-related
charges.[27][28]

On September 22, 2023, Democratic U.S. Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey and
his wife Nadine were both indicted on bribery charges.[29][30]

On December 19, 2023, the Colorado Supreme Court removed Trump from the
state's 2024 Republican primary, citing the Fourteenth Amendment's ban on
candidates who engage in insurrections.[31] This decision was later overturned
by the US Supreme Court on March 4, 2024.[32]

## Federal elections

### Presidential election

Main article: 2024 United States presidential election

The 2024 United States presidential election will be the 60th quadrennial U.S.
presidential election. This will be the first presidential election under the
electoral vote distribution determined by the 2020 census. Presidential
electors who will elect the President and Vice President of the United States
will be chosen; a simple majority (270) of the 538 electoral votes is required
to win the election. President Joe Biden initially ran for a second term and
won the primaries, with Vice President Kamala Harris once again serving as his
running mate; Biden later withdrew his candidacy on July 21, 2024.[33] Biden's
withdrawal made him the first eligible incumbent president since Lyndon B.
Johnson in 1968 not to seek re-election, and the first to withdraw after
securing enough delegates to win the nomination.[34] Harris is the first
nominee who did not participate in the primaries since Vice President Hubert
Humphrey, also in 1968.[35] Other candidates that entered the 2024 Democratic
Party presidential primaries include Minnesota US Representative Dean
Phillips, self-help author Marianne Williamson, and businessman Jason Palmer,
who have all since suspended their campaigns.[36][37] This is the first
election since 1968 in which an eligible incumbent president was not their
party's nominee.[38] After a survey by the Associated Press of Democratic
delegates on July 22, 2024, Kamala Harris became the new presumptive candidate
for the Democratic party, a day after declaring her candidacy.[39] She would
become the official nominee on August 5 following a virtual roll call of
delegates.[40]

In November 2022, former President Donald Trump announced his candidacy in the
2024 presidential election.[41] Other candidates who entered the 2024
Republican Party presidential primaries include former South Carolina governor
and former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley and current Florida
governor Ron DeSantis, who have since suspended their campaigns.[42] The first
Republican presidential debate was held on August 23, 2023, and the first
primary contest was the 2024 Iowa Republican presidential caucuses, which was
held on January 15, 2024.[43] Trump would win the nomination easily; he was
formally nominated at the Republican Convention on July 15, his third
consecutive presidential nomination.[44]

In October 2023, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced his run as an independent
presidential candidate.[45] On August 23, 2024, Kennedy announced he was
suspending his campaign and backing Trump.[46] In July, intermediaries between
Trump and Kennedy discussed a possible role for Kennedy in the Trump
administration in return for his endorsement;[47] a month later, Kennedy made
similar overtures to the Harris campaign, but was rebuffed.[48]

### Congressional elections

#### Senate elections

Main article: 2024 United States Senate elections

All 33 seats in Senate Class 1 and one seat in Senate Class 2 will be up for
election; at least one additional special election will take place to fill
vacancies that arise during the 118th Congress. Democrats control the majority
in the closely divided Senate following the 2022 U.S. Senate elections, but
they will have to defend 23 seats in 2024. Three Democratic-held seats up for
election are in the heavily Republican-leaning states of Montana, Ohio, and
West Virginia, all of which were won comfortably by Trump in both 2016 and
2020.[49] Other potential Republican targets include seats in Arizona,
Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Maryland, while Democrats may
target Republican-held seats in Florida and Texas.[50]

Two special elections are scheduled to fill the unexpired terms of senators
who vacated their seats during the 118th Congress:

  * California Class 1: Democrat Dianne Feinstein died on September 29, 2023. Laphonza Butler was appointed by California governor Gavin Newsom to fill the seat until the special election, which will take place concurrently with the regular election for a six-year term.[54][55]

in 2024.

  * New Jersey's 10th congressional district: Democrat LaMonica McIver defeated Republican Carmen Bucco to succeed Democrat Donald Payne Jr., who died on April 24, 2024, from complications following a heart attack.[63] The district has a partisan index of D+30.[58]
  * Wisconsin's 8th congressional district: Republican Mike Gallagher resigned on April 24, 2024.[64] The district has a partisan index of R+10.[58]
  * Texas's 18th congressional district: Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee died on July 19, 2024.[65] The district has a partisan index of D+23.[58]

police department.[134]

2024. Note that not all states and territories hold gubernatorial, state
legislative, and Senate elections in 2024. The five territories and
Washington, D.C., do not elect members of the Senate, and the territories do
not take part in presidential elections; instead, they each elect one non-
voting member of the House. Nebraska's unicameral legislature and the
governorship and legislature of American Samoa are elected on a non-partisan
basis, and political party affiliation is not listed.

## Violent threats

The election campaign has been marked by widespread doxxing, swatting, and
threats against politicians and activists, with a particular series of
incidents starting in December 2023.[138][139][140]

On July 13, 2024, during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania,
presidential candidate Donald Trump was shot in a failed assassination
attempt. Trump was shot in the upper right ear, while one supporter was killed
and two others were critically injured.[141] On September 15, 2024, Trump's
security detail spotted an armed man while the former president was touring
his golf course in West Palm Beach. They opened fire on the suspect, who fled
in a vehicle and was later captured thanks to the contribution of an
eyewitness. In the location where the suspect was spotted, the police
retrieved a modified SKS rifle with a scope, two rucksacks and a GoPro in what
was called a second assassination attempt.[142]
