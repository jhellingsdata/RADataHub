Presidential elections were held in Algeria on 7 September 2024.[1][2]
Originally scheduled for December 2024, they were brought forward by President
Abdelmadjid Tebboune. Tebboune was challenged by Youcef Aouchiche of the
Socialist Forces Front and Abdellah Hassan Cherif of the Movement of Society
for Peace. Tebboune won a second term in office. Conflicting reports about the
election's turnout by the National Independent Electoral Authority led to
criticism from the three candidates. Aouchiche and Cherif challenged the
results.

## Background

[edit]

On 21 March 2024, the office of incumbent President Abdelmadjid Tebboune
announced that the election would be held on 7 September. This announcement
was unexpected, as the election had been anticipated to occur in December as
they were in 2019.[2] Tebboune later explained that the date was the optimal
time to hold the election "because it coincides with the end of the summer
vacations and the start of the new school year", hereby ensuring high turnout.
However, some have questioned the logic of the timing, pointing out that a
September election would mean that campaigning would be held amid scorching
summer temperatures.[3]

Tebboune's selection of the election date was supported by his former
political party, the FLN, which said that it was considering whether to
endorse Tebboune or field its own candidate. Islamist parties also supported
the election date, with Movement of Society for Peace leader Abderrazak Makri
[fr] expressing interest in running for President, pending the party's
decision on a scheduled summit in June. The Socialist Forces Front promised to
make the election "an occasion for a great debate", while the Rally for
Culture and Democracy described the early election as a "constitutional coup
de force" that would force a timeline causing "the de facto exclusion of
society as a whole."[3]

Tebboune's decision to set the elections in September also led to confusion
among the Algerian public, with the Algerian Arabic phrase _Ma fhemna walou_
(ما فهمنا ولو, "We didn't understand anything") becoming a trending topic on
social media as a result.[3]

## Electoral system

[edit]

The President of Algeria is elected using the two-round system; if no
candidate had received a majority of the vote in the first round, a second
round would have been held.[4] Candidates needed signatures from 600 elected
officials or from 50,000 members of the public to be listed on the ballot.[5]
For this election, there were around 24.5 million registered voters.[6] This
election was administered by the National Independent Electoral Authority,
which was established in 2019 as a response to demands from pro-democracy
protestors. Algeria's Interior Ministry had previously been in charge of
elections.[7]

## Candidates

[edit]

On 11 July, Abdelmadjid Tebboune announced his decision to run for a second
term.[8]

Zoubida Assoul, a lawyer and former magistrate, announced her decision to run
for president as the leader of the Union for Reform and Progress [fr]
(UCP).[9] A total of 34 people expressed their intention to run for the
presidency, including Youcef Aouchiche of the Socialist Forces Front, Abdellah
Hassan Cherif of the Movement of Society for Peace; and Sadia Naghzi of the
General Confederation of Algerian Enterprises. Prospective candidates were
required to collect a minimum number of signatures to register their candidacy
before 18 July.[10] The number of candidates was subsequently reduced to
15.[11]

On 13 July, Louisa Hanoune of the Workers' Party announced her withdrawal of
her candidacy as president, citing "unfair conditions".[12]

On 1 August, the attorney general of the court of Algiers announced the
opening of an in-depth preliminary investigation concerning the sale of
sponsorships by more than 50 elected officials to candidates for the
presidential election. The prosecution announced that all the candidates
involved will be arrested on the basis of the anti-corruption legislation in
force.[13]

Only three candidates were allowed to appear on the final ballot: Tebboune,
Aouchiche and Cherif.[14]

## Campaign

[edit]

Attendance at campaign events was marred by low turnout due to high summer
temperatures. Throughout the election season, Tebboune highlighted his
administration's achievements despite corruption and the COVID-19 pandemic in
Algeria, while pledging to create 450,000 jobs after he is reelected and raise
monthly unemployment benefits for people aged 19 to 40 from 13,000 dinars to
20,000, equivalent to the Algerian minimum wage.[15] Both Hassani and
Aouchiche campaigned on allowing greater political and media freedoms, with
the latter also promising an amnesty for "prisoners of conscience" and a
review of "unjust laws".[16] Although the candidates encouraged people to
vote, other activists and political parties called for a boycott.[17]

## Conduct

[edit]

On 21 July, a group of 11 opposition figures released an open letter
denouncing what they called "the authoritarian climate" surrounding the
election, adding that it was a "rubber-stamp" exercise.[11]

Overseas voting, covering around 800,000 Algerians, began on 2 September,
while mobile polling stations servicing remote areas of Algeria began
operating on 4 September.[16] On 7 September, polling opened at 08:00 and was
originally supposed to close at 19:00[18] before it was extended by an
hour.[19] Domestic turnout was estimated to be at around 48%, while turnout in
overseas balloting was at 19.6%.[20]

On 8 September, opposition candidate Abdelaali Hassani Cherif's campaign
stated they recorded instances of voter fraud and election violations, namely
that polling station officials inflated the results, failed to deliver vote-
sorting records to the candidates' representatives, and instances of proxy
group voting.[21]

Despite being proclaimed the winner, on 9 September Abdelmadjid Tebboune
joined Cherif and Aouchiche in criticizing the central election authority when
it was revealed the real turnout was only 23.3% instead of the 48% it had
reported earlier.[22] Algerian commentators speculated that Tebboune's
decision to criticize the election authority after being declared the winner
suggested that there was a dispute among Algeria's ruling elite.[7] On 10
September, Cherif and Aouchiche filed an appeal at the Constitutional Court of
Algeria challenging the results.[23] On 14 September, the court ruled that
Tebboune had won the election but found that his share of the vote was lower
than initially announced,[24] winning 84.3% of votes instead of around
95%.[25] A record 15.72% of votes cast were invalid or blank.[_citation
