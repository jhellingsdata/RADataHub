Parliamentary elections are scheduled to be held in Chad on 29 December 2024,
along with elections for regional and local offices.[1]

## Background

[edit]

The last parliamentary term that began in June 2011 was originally scheduled
to end in June 2015, but was extended.[2] President Idriss Déby announced on 2
February 2017 that the election would be delayed because the government did
not have sufficient funds in the midst of an economic slump: "When we have
resources, we can hold parliamentary elections". He also urged the opposition
to engage in dialogue and "stop cultivating hatred that results in dividing
the country".[3]

In June 2017, members of the FONAC opposition coalition argued that the
National Assembly became illegitimate by continuing to sit beyond 21 June, two
years after the extension of the parliamentary term, and that deputies from
the opposition should consequently resign. Opposition deputies led by Saleh
Kebzabo responded that they would not resign, feeling that it would be more
"useful" for them to remain in the National Assembly; however, they also said
that the next election should be held promptly, dismissing Déby's view that
the delay was necessary due to a lack of funds, and that in the future the
government should make every effort to hold elections on time.[2]

The election was later rescheduled to November 2018.[4] When this deadline too
was not met, a new one of May 2019 was proposed by the government.[5] The new
National Independent Elections Commission (CENI) was sworn in by the Supreme
Court on 4 April 2019 despite protests by segments of the opposition regarding
its impartiality.[6] On 5 April, the Coordination des Partis Politiques pour
la Défense de la Constitution (CPDC) comprising a dozen opposition parties
controlling 31 seats in the 188-seat National Assembly rejected the swearing-
in, calling it "illegally constituted, null and void and of no effect."[7] The
country's election board said “the realistic time frame for holding
legislative elections is the first quarter of 2020”.[8] At the beginning of
that year a date was set for 9 August 2020, shortly thereafter amended to 13
December, citing increased attacks by Boko Haram around Lake Chad.[9][10] With
the COVID-19 pandemic the election was postponed yet again to April, then
October, 2021, and later September 2022.[11][12][13] The junta later announced
a further postponement of elections for two years, scheduling elections for
around October 2024.[14]

On 21 August 2024, the Chadian National Election Management Agency (ANGE)
announced that parliamentary and local elections would be held on 29 December
2024.[1]

## Electoral system

[edit]

The minimum voting age is 18. All Chadian citizens not prohibited from voting
by the Electoral Code are eligible to participate.

The members of the National Assembly are elected from constituencies
coterminous with the Departments of Chad, plus the arrondissements of
N'Djamena and one constituency for voters abroad. Each constituency is
allocated seats based on its population. In constituencies with one seat,
first-past-the-post voting is used. In multi-member constituencies, a party
winning over 50% of the vote wins all the seats; if no party wins over 50% of
the vote, seats are allocated proportionally using the largest remainders
method.

The submission of candidacies will run from 19 to 28 October, while final
election results are expected on 3 February 2025.[1]

## Reactions

[edit]

In October 2024, the country's largest opposition party, Les Transformateurs,
and 15 other opposition parties, said that they would boycott the election,
citing concerns about a "corrupt" electoral register and a lack of guarantees
that the election would be free and fair.[15][16]
