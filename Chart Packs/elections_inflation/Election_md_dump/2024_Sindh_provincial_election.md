Provincial elections were held in Sindh on 8 February 2024 to elect a new
provincial legislature.[2] On 5 August 2023, after the approval of the results
of the 2023 digital census by the Council of Common Interests headed by Prime
Minister Shehbaz Sharif, elections have been delayed for several months, as
new delimitations will be published on 14 December 2023.[3][4] On 2 November
2023, the Election Commission of Pakistan announced, in agreement with the
President of Pakistan, Arif Alvi, that the elections should be held on 8
February 2024.[5] This election was held concurrently with nationwide general
elections and other provincial elections.

## Background

[edit]

In the 2018 election, the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) won 99 seats, gaining
a majority in the Provincial Assembly. It became the third consecutive time
that the PPP was able to form government in Sindh Since 2008.[6]

The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) became the largest party in Karachi by
winning 21 out of 44 seats from the city. It was the first time since 1988
that any party other than the MQM-P got the mandate to represent the city on
the provincial and national levels.[7] Overall, the PTI won 30 seats and
became the second largest party, and the largest party in the opposition.

The Muttahida Qaumi Movement - Pakistan (MQM-P), which was the largest and
most popular party in Karachi, Hyderabad and other urban areas of Sindh, faced
a tough challenge from the rising popularity of the PTI and received its worst
ever result. It won only 21 seats and became the third largest party in the
province. The MQM-P also opted to join the opposition.

In April 2022, after circumstances arising during a political crisis in
Pakistan after the successful no-confidence motion against Prime Minister
Imran Khan, the MQM-P left the opposition and joined the PPP-led provincial
government.

In September 2022, Former Prime Minister and Leader of Pakistan Tehreek-e-
Insaf Imran Khan announced to liberate Sindh from Zardari Mafia.[8] He stated
that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf will team up with the youth to liberate the poor
and oppressed people of Interior Sindh from Feudal lords of Pakistan People's
Party.[9] This was the very first time some party leader threatened dominance
of People's Party in Sindh and upcoming election will be a battle for survival
of PPP[10] in interior Sindh as Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf has support of the
people of Karachi and Hyderabad and will be able to gain seats in Interior
Sindh if they campaign well.[11]

### Merger of MQM factions

[edit]

Since the appointment of Kamran Tessori as the Governor of Sindh, efforts
began to merge breakaway factions of the MQM-P like the Pak Sarzameen Party
(PSP) and the Farooq Sattar group back into the MQM-P to unite their vote bank
to overcome the growing popularity of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).[12][13]
The Mohajir Qaumi Movement Pakistan - Haqiqi (MQM-H) was also approached, but
refused to merge the with the MQM-P.[14]

On the evening of 12 January 2023 Syed Mustafa Kamal, the leader of the PSP,
and Farooq Sattar announced their merger with the MQM-P in a press
conference.[15]

### Ban on PTI from contesting as a party

[edit]

On 22 December 2023, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) decided against
letting the PTI retain its electoral symbol, arguing that the party had failed
to hold intra-party elections. On 22 December, the PTI approached the Peshawar
High Court (PHC) against the ECP's order and hence, a single-member bench
suspended the ECP's order until 9 January 2024. On 30 December 2023, the ECP
filed a review application within the PHC, and days later, a two-member bench
withdrew the suspension order as it heard the case. However, on 10 January
2024, the two-member bench had declared the ECP's order to be "illegal,
without any lawful authority, and of no legal effect. On 11 January, the ECP
challenged this ruling in the Supreme Court, and on 13 January, a three-member
bench ruled in favor of the ECP and stripped the PTI of its electoral symbol.
As a consequence of this ruling, the PTI could not allot party tickets to any
of its candidates. Therefore, all candidates of the party will be listed as
independent candidates and each will have a different electoral symbol.[16]

## Schedule

[edit]

The schedule of the election was announced by the Election Commission of
Pakistan on 15 December 2023.[17]

## Notes

[edit]

  1. **^** 29 seats are reserved for women and 9 are reserved for non-Muslims filled through Proportional representation
  2. **^** This is a column that lists the percentage of undecided voters and non-voters in certain polls that publish this data. As some polls do not publish any data whatsoever on undecided voters and non-voters, the columns with survey participants that had a preference when polled are all that is needed to reach 100%. In surveys that do include data on non-voters and undecided voters, a scaling factor is applied to the margin of error and the rest of the data (for example, if the number of undecideds and non-voters equals 20%, each party would have their vote share scaled up by a factor of 100/80 (the formula is 100/(100-UndecidedPercentage)). This is done to keep consistency between the different polls and the different types data they provide.
  3. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ This poll or crosstabulation did not include any data about undecided voters or non-voters and cut them out completely from the published results.
  4. **^** Panel name of Independent candidates supported by MQM's London faction controlled by its founder Altaf Hussain[20][21][22][23]
  5. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ Backed by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf
