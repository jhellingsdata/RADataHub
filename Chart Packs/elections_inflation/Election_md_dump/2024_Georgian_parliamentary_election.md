Parliamentary elections were held in Georgia on 26 October 2024.[2][3][4] The
elections were held under the rules passed in 2017 through the constitutional
amendments which shifted the electoral system towards a fully proportional
representation with a 5% electoral threshold.[5]

The ruling Georgian Dream (GD) party sought to win its fourth term in office.
Its founder, Bidzina Ivanishvili—an influential oligarch and former prime
minister often regarded as the country's _éminence grise_ following his
official departure from politics in 2021—returned to politics several months
before the polls to lead GD in the elections.[6]

In its campaign, the Georgian Dream promoted the Global War Party conspiracy
theory, promising "safeguarding peace" through a "pragmatic policy" with
Russia amid the war in Ukraine;[7][8][9][10] socially conservative policies,
particularly the recent "LGBT propaganda law" and strengthening status of
Georgian Orthodox Church in the constitution,[11] outlawing most major
opposition parties;[12][13][14] joining the European Union whilst "playing by
Georgian rules";[15] and restoring the country's territorial integrity, with
Ivanishvili making overtures to the Kremlin, and calling for an apology for
Georgia's role in the 2008 war.[16][17]

During the pre-election period, the opponents of GD have focused on
criticizing what they describe as pro-Russian shift of the party and its
unwillingness to fulfill the criteria set by the European Commission for EU
accession, campaigning for the European integration.[7][18][19]

The election was preceded by the 2023–2024 Georgian protests over
controversial legislation requiring organizations receiving foreign funding to
register as "foreign agents", sparking accusations of
authoritarianism.[20][21] This law has strained relations with the West; the
European Union and the United States initiated a variety of measures against
the law, including U.S. visa designations and financial sanctions against
several Georgian officials,[22] _de facto_ freezing Georgia's European Union
membership candidate status,[23][24] and proposed U.S. Congress MEGOBARI Act
and the Georgian People's Act.[25][26] However, these measures have also been
criticized by some as interference in Georgia's internal affairs by the US and
EU in order to protect the large network of Western-funded NGOs in
Georgia.[32]

Based on preliminary results published by Central Election Commission of
Georgia, Georgian Dream declared victory in the election with more than 53% of
the vote, while the four major opposition coalitions—which agreed not to
cooperate with Georgian Dream in the parliament through their Georgian
Charter—received 37.78% in total. Georgian Dream posted the highest results in
rural areas, particularly in the Samtskhe-Javakheti, Kvemo Kartli, Svaneti,
Racha-Lechkhumi, Guria, and Adjara regions, but lost the capital Tbilisi and
also Rustavi to the opposition, while only closely winning other major cities.
In the capital, GD received 42% of the vote, while the four major opposition
coalitions combined received 46%; the smaller libertarian Girchi party won
5.3%. Georgian Dream also dramatically lost to the opposition among the
Georgian diaspora.[33]

The four major opposition coalitions and President Salome Zourabichvili
claimed that the elections were marred with reported instances of vote-buying
and ballot-box stuffing, as well as intimidation and pressure on voters. They
accused Georgian Dream of "stealing the election", with Zourabichvili refusing
to recognize the official results, which she called "illegitimate".[34][33]
The opposition announced that it was going to boycott the new parliament.[35]
The European Union and the United States have called for an investigation into
these allegations, with the ambassador of the European Union to Georgia Paweł
Herczyński stating that "international observers have not declared the
elections to be free and fair. Neither have they declared the contrary".[36]
On 30 October, the Prosecutor's Office of Georgia launched investigation into
the election fraud allegations.[37]

## Background

[edit]

### Political context

[edit]

Main articles: Georgia and the Russian invasion of Ukraine and 2023–2024
Georgian protests

By the time of the elections, Georgian Dream had been the ruling party in
Georgia since defeating Mikheil Saakashvili's United National Movement (UNM)
in the 2012 parliamentary election. Announcing its plans to pursue a policy of
joining the European Union and NATO, Georgian Dream has also professed a more
conciliatory approach towards Russia compared to its anti-Russian
opponents.[38]

However, the geopolitical strain of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict have made it more difficult to maintain a
balancing act, amid statements from Ukrainian politicians that Georgia would
have "greatly aided" Ukraine by opening a "second front" against Russia[39]
and Western efforts to isolate Russia with international sanctions.[40]

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Georgian government condemned
Russian actions and provided humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, but did not
join sanctions against Russia, which allowed an influx of Russian capital and
highly skilled Russians dodging military mobilization.[41] Russia, in turn,
did not approve the proposal of Georgia's breakaway _de facto_ South Ossetian
republic to hold a referendum on joining the Russian Federation[42] and,
despite otherwise hostile relations, has not put Georgia on its unfriendly
countries list.[43]

On 25 February 2022, large protests took place in front of the Georgian
parliament in Tbilisi, lasting for six consecutive days to show solidarity
with Ukraine. The demonstration took on an anti-government tone, reflecting
growing frustration with the Georgian authorities' allegedly inadequate
response to Russian invasion.[44][45][46]

Elene Khoshtaria, leader of the Droa party, addressed the crowd, demanding the
resignation of Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili and his administration. She
called for immediate and effective actions to support Ukraine, such as closing
the sky to Russia, and urged Georgia to apply for EU membership.[47]

Ukraine_solidarity_protests_in_Tbilisi%2C_Georgia_26.02.2022_16.jpg)Protesters
in Tbilisi condemn the Georgian government's allegedly insufficient support
for Ukraine.

The rally also underscored dissatisfaction with the government's handling of
the crisis. Protesters were angered by obstacles created for volunteers and
the government's refusal to join Western sanctions against Russia.[48] On 28
February, Georgian authorities did not give landing permission to a Ukrainian
charter sent to transport Georgian volunteers from Georgia to Ukraine.[49]
Georgian Dream's leader Mamuka Mdinaradze said that Georgia could not send
volunteers to Ukraine because Georgia was in vulnerable position and it would
risk a war with Russia.[50] In response, Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy decided to recall Ukraine's ambassador to Georgia.[51] Prime
Minister Irakli Garibashvili also announced that Georgia would not join
Western sanctions against Russia because it would harm the Georgian economy
more than it would hurt Russia, fueling the rising anti-government sentiment
in the protests.[52] Garibashvili also noted that neither the West nor Ukraine
imposed sanctions on Russia during or after the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, and
even continued "business as usual", including a Russian reset, while Georgia
was being asked to sacrifice itself and "destroy its economy".[53]

In June 2022, the European Union refused to approve Georgia's application to
join the union, citing alleged media censorship and the government's refusal
to join international sanctions against Russia.[54] This led to mobilization
by the opposition against the government.[55] In turn, the sovereignist
faction People's Power broke away from Georgian Dream in August 2022, and
proposed legislation to regulate foreign influence by creating a special
registry to monitor politically active foreign-funded organizations, many of
which are Western-funded.[56][57] While the government claimed that the bill
was necessary for public disclosure and transparency, the opposition, aided by
the statements of Western embassies and politicians, managed to mobilize
protests to tackle the bill, likening it to Russian foreign agent law and
saying that it would have jeopardized Euro-Atlantic integration, ultimately
leading to the parliament withdrawing the bill.[58]

On 8 March 2023, tens of thousands of people gathered in front of the
Parliament, demanding a halt to further discussions on the law. Opposition
leader Giorgi Vashadze issued an ultimatum, calling for the rejection of the
bills and the release of those detained during the protests.[59]

Amid protests in Tbilisi, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement,
cautioning against the violent change of power in Georgia,[60] with some
Russian politicians suggesting Russia might use military means in case of
"instability on the Russian border". In September 2023, the State Security
Service of Georgia claimed to have uncovered plans of the opposition and the
Western-funded groups to stage a coup in Georgia with the support of Ukraine-
based Georgian oppositionist politicians.[61][62] This in turn led to the pro-
Russian Georgian opposition Conservative Movement party and the TV channel
Alt-Info starting to mobilize an "Anti-Maidan movement" to counter the alleged
coup.[63]

However, in December 2023, the European Union decided to grant Georgia
candidate status following the release from prison of opposition journalist
Nika Gvaramia, who had been arrested on charges of abuse of power and
embezzlement, and the parliament's decision to turn down impeachment
proceedings against pro-opposition president Salome Zourabichvili.[64][65][66]
In late December 2023, Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili summarized
the year by saying that the government had managed to "preserve the peace"
amid the threat of destabilization caused by "radical groups and hostile
forces operating within the country",[67] and also to secure EU candidate
status for Georgia.[68] In early 2024, Georgia again experienced a significant
political crisis and public unrest due to the reintroduction of the "foreign
agent" law, which many citizens perceived as a threat to civil liberties and
democratic principles. The leader of parliamentary majority, Mamuka
Mdinaradze, said that the reason for reintroduction of the bill was the
continued circulation of slush funds in the country through non-governmental
organizations and covert foreign financing of political activities.[69] On 8
April, the Bureau of the Parliament of Georgia registered the bill for the
parliamentary discussions.[70] Critics said that the law, requiring
organizations and individuals receiving foreign funding to register as
"organizations carrying the interests of a foreign power," was a measure to
stifle dissent and limit the activities of NGOs and independent media.
Protests erupted across the country, with demonstrators calling for the repeal
of the law and the "protection of democratic freedoms". The government's
response to the protests varied, with some efforts to engage in dialogue,
while many instances of police violence were reported.[20][71][21]

Ivanishvili addressing a rally supporting the Georgian Law on Transparency of
Foreign Influence, 29 April 2024

On 11 May, a record-breaking protest rally took place, widely regarded as the
largest in Georgian history. Despite the rain, tens of thousands gathered at
four key locations in Tbilisi: First Republic Square, Marjanishvili Metro, 300
Aragveli Metro, and Tsereteli Avenue. Demonstrators marched along both banks
of the Kura, with the four streams of protesters converging symbolically at
Europe Square in Metekhi to celebrate Europe Day. Estimates suggest that at
least 169,000 people participated, with some reports indicating peak numbers
of up to 200,000 or even 300,000.[72][73][74]

The widespread opposition to the law underscored deep-seated concerns about
the future of democracy and human rights in Georgia.[75] Protesters and other
critics, including the European Union and Western countries, spoke out against
the bill, arguing that it would stifle democracy and freedom of the press in
Georgia and comparing it to the Russian foreign agent law.[76] European Union
and the United States officials have been vocal in their opposition to the
bill, considering that "Georgia does not need this law" and that its passage
despite repeated calls from the EU "to retract such legislation" was
unacceptable.[77][78][79][80] Proponents of the bill denied this
characterization, claiming it would ensure transparency of foreign funding and
protect Georgia's sovereignty from malign foreign influence. People's Power
has argued that the law would protect democracy and the sovereignty of Georgia
from foreign interference through financing of NGOs with a goal of promotion
of foreign agendas.[81][82] Some have also criticized the European Union and
the United States for interfering in Georgia's internal affairs and
undermining its sovereign power to pass its own laws, and blackmailing Georgia
with European Union candidate status and US sanctions in order to maintain
their right to interfere into Georgia's sovereign ability through "unlimited"
and "undisclosed" foreign funding of NGOs.[29][30] They have also emphasized
that local NGOs should be grassroots rather than reliant on foreign
funding.[30]

In August 2024, Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said that he
expected the elections to be held against the backdrop of "unprecedented" and
"disruptive" foreign interference.[83] His expectation was also shared by the
Speaker of Parliament Shalva Papuashvili, who cited the Danish government-
sponsored "Festival of Democracy" event, organised by the non-profit
organisation Eastern European Centre for Multiparty Democracy in Telavi,
presenting banners demanding the release of Mikheil Saakashvili from prison.
He said that foreign funding was funneled into Georgian politics for the
purpose of election campaigning in favor of the radical opposition parties
against the ruling party.[84]

On 5 October, President Salome Zourabichvili announced in an interview that
she has a candidate in mind for the position of Prime Minister if the creation
of a coalition government becomes relevant. She noted that the Georgian
Charter requires the Prime Minister to be selected in consultation with the
President. While she did not disclose the candidate's identity, Zourabichvili
emphasized that the person has no political background, which she believes is
important for building public trust and reducing political polarization. She
also mentioned that she will soon begin negotiations with opposition parties
that signed the charter.[85][86] A day later, Shalva Papuashvili, during a
briefing, revealed that the impeachment procedure against the president would
be re-initiated. He cited her foreign visits without government permission,
including trips to France, Germany, and Poland last week, as one of the
reasons for the move.[87]

On 20 October 2024, thousands of Georgians gathered in Tbilisi for a pro-
European rally, just days before the elections. Demonstrators, carrying
Georgian and EU flags, converged at Freedom Square after marching from five
different locations across the city. The crowd chanted the national anthem and
sang the EU anthem, _Ode to Joy_ , while holding banners with messages like
"Georgia chooses the European Union".[88][89] The rally was attended by an
estimated 90,000 to 100,000 people.[90]

Zourabichvili joined the rally at Freedom Square, where she reaffirmed
Georgia's commitment to joining the EU. In her speech, she expressed
solidarity with Ukraine and Moldova, directly addressing their leaders,
Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Maia Sandu. Zourabichvili praised Sandu's leadership,
endorsing her re-election bid and wishing for pro-European outcomes in the
upcoming referendum. She commended Sandu for successfully guiding Moldova on
its European path. Additionally, Zourabichvili extended her support to
Zelenskyy, emphasizing that his fight against Russia is not only for Ukraine
but also for Georgia, as both nations face shared Russian aggression. In
conclusion, she urged Georgia's European and American partners to recognize
the country's unwavering commitment to a European future, declaring that
Georgia is already a winner on its path towards EU integration.[91]

### Georgian Charter

[edit]

Main article: Georgian Charter

On 26 May 2024, In response to the 2023–2024 protests, President Salome
Zourabichvili introduced the Georgian Charter, an action plan aimed at
"fostering unity among opposition parties ahead of the parliamentary
elections". The Charter, announced during Georgia's Independence Day
celebrations, seeks to create a platform for the opposition to present a
unified stance. Zourabichvili's proposal emphasizes a new electoral format
where voters will choose between the ruling party and a coalition of
opposition parties. The plan includes forming a temporary government post-
elections to implement key reforms intended to "enhance democratic processes
and align Georgia more closely with European standards", after which new
elections will be held. The Charter's main goals include repealing laws that
the opposition considers as hindrances to European integration and undertaking
significant judicial and electoral reforms to ensure "a fair and democratic
process".[92][93][94]

The president emphasized that the October parliamentary elections should
focused on the question of "what direction the country should take rather than
which individuals or parties should be elected". She stated that the 2024
elections will effectively act as a referendum on whether Georgia seeks closer
integration with Europe.[95]So far 17 political parties from the opposition,
including UNM, Strategy Aghmashenebeli, Ahali, Lelo, European Georgia, Girchi
– More Freedom, Droa, Citizens, For Georgia,[96] For the People, the
Republican Party, the Greens Party of Georgia, For Justice, European
Democrats, Law and Justice, Tavisupleba, State for the People and the National
Democratic Party, as well as 5 individual MPs have signed the Georgian Charter
presented by the president.[97][98][99]

Some opposition parties refused to sign the agreement. Girchi has praised
Zourabichvili's initiative for attempting to bring opposition together,
nevertheless, they criticized her for not taking their opinions into
consideration and refused to sign it.[100][101] Initially the For Georgia
party also did not join the agreement, saying that they supported the reforms
outlined in the charter, however, they said that talking about forming a
temporary government post-elections was damaging to the pre-election
process.[102] However, For Georgia later reversed its decision and signed the
Charter.[103]

The ruling party MP Nino Tsilosani alleged that the opposition parties did not
sign the agreement independently but were "influenced by Western
embassies".[104]

## Parties and coalitions

[edit]

There was a split within the largest opposition United National Movement party
months prior to the elections.[105] In January 2023, Levan Khabeishvili
unseated Nika Melia from the position of United National Movement chairman
after winning internal party elections. Accusing Khabeishvili of being a
protégé of shadowy businessman Davit Kezerashvili, Melia announced a break
with the UNM and plans for his own party in December 2023.[106] On 11 March
2024, Melia announced the formation of Ahali party. He was joined by Nika
Gvaramia, another former UNM member and founder of pro-opposition Mtavari
Arkhi TV.[107] On 8 June, Tinatin Bokuchava became chair of the United
National Movement, succeeding Khabeishvili, who resigned due to health
complications.[108]

On 20 July 2023, the United National Movement announced an alliance with
Strategy Aghmashenebeli of Giorgi Vashadze.[109] According to Khabeishvili,
the coalition, named "Victory Platform", will center around former president
Mikheil Saakashvili. Imprisoned on charges of abuse of power and violence,
Saakashvili will lead his party in the election from prison.[110]

On 30 December 2023, Bidzina Ivanishvili, a founder of Georgian Dream,
announced his return to politics as honorary chairman of Georgian Dream,
suggesting he would play an active role in the election campaign.[6]

On 8 February 2024, Irakli Kobakhidze was confirmed by the parliament as the
new Prime Minister from the ruling Georgian Dream party.[111]

In March 2024, the People's Power movement was registered as a political
party, and is expected to participate in the election.[112]

On 11 April, the Public Registry revoked the registration of the Conservative
Movement party, banning it from participating in the election. In June 2024,
it was announced that the party would merge with the Alliance of Patriots of
Georgia and run together in the election.[113][114]

On 8 July, the Chair of the United National Movement, Tina Bokuchava,
announced a new political platform named "Unity – to Save Georgia". This
platform aims to bring together the United National Movement, Strategy
Agmashenebeli — two parties that have been in "Victory Platform" coalition for
a year already — as well as representatives from other parties, civil society,
and academia. The new platform will use the UNM ballot number 5 in the
upcoming elections.[115]

On 9 July, three opposition parties, Ahali, Girchi – More Freedom, and Droa,
announced their decision to post a joint election list for the Parliamentary
elections in October. The leaders mentioned that an expected alliance with
another party, Lelo, did not materialize due to "minor differences".[116]
Subsequently, this alliance was renamed to "Coalition for Change".[117] On 18
August, the Republican Party and the youth organization of Georgian
Azerbaijanis "Activists for the Future" joined the coalition.[118][119][120]

On 24 June 2024, the leader of Alliance of Patriots of Georgia, Irma Inashvili
announced that ten conservative parties and civic organizations signed the
"Declaration of Unity of the Patriots of Georgia," starting a coalition aimed
at unifying traditionalist forces to promote a conservative agenda in the next
parliament. The declaration invited all individuals who shared this worldview
to join, fostering inclusivity while critiquing the dominant narratives of the
GD and the UNM, which have "marginalized conservative voices." Its primary
goal is to ensure robust representation of conservative values and interests
in the Georgian Parliament.[121][122][123] On 10 July, it was reported that
several parties would run under the banner of Alliance of Patriots alongside
Conservative Movement/Alt Info to foster a joint electoral efforts: Georgian
Idea, Georgian Mission, Conservative-Monarchist Party, Christian-Democratic
Movement, and National Unit.[124]

On 16 July, Mamuka Mdinaradze, Executive Secretary of Georgian Dream,
announced during his speech at the opening of the election campaign and the
new central office of Georgian Dream that People's Power will participate in
the parliamentary elections with a common list alongside the ruling Georgian
Dream party.[125][126]

On 17 July, Lelo for Georgia, For the People, and the political movement
Freedom Square announced their unification under a single electoral list for
the upcoming elections.[127] Subsequently, this alliance was renamed to
"Strong Georgia". Later in August, the Citizens party also joined the
alliance.[128]

On 1 August, a majority of the European Georgia electoral list, chosen during
the party's internal primary election, left the party, including key figures
Giga Bokeria and Tamar Chergoleishvili. The split arose from disagreements
with other key figures, Gigi Tsereteli and Akaki Bobokhidze over the primary
results.[129][130]

Later, on 15 August, the members who left European Georgia formally
established a new party called the Federalists.[131][132] 2 days later
European Georgia, in an announcement with the Unity coalition, announced that
it would be running on a joint list with the UNM and Strategy
Aghmashenebeli.[133] On 25 September the Federalists confirmed that they will
not participate in the elections, as they were late in registering the party.
Despite this, the party called on its supporters to remain engaged and vote
against the Georgian Dream.[134]

The Central Election Commission of Georgia refused to register European
Socialists, Union of Georgian Traditionalists and Generations for Georgia
parties, citing their failure to comply with the legislative requirement to
present signatures of 25 thousands voters for the registration. Along with
them, 8 other parties were refused registration. Therefore, they will not take
part in the elections.[135] Ilia Injia, the son of European Socialists leader
Fridon Injia became a Georgian Dream candidate.[136]

At a special briefing on 16 September, Salome Zourabichvili emphasized the
need for a "positive, third center" to provide opposition-leaning and
undecided voters with a clearer choice and announced the forthcoming coalition
of two major opposition forces: Strong Georgia and ex-Prime Minister Giorgi
Gakharia's For Georgia.[137]

She expressed her support for their readiness to unite and invited them to the
Orbeliani Palace on 17 September to complete the final steps of the
negotiations. Zourabichvili concluded by asserting, "I am confident that this
is what society expects from you."[138][139] The Georgian Dream MP Giorgi
Kakhiani accused the President of allegedly showing her political symphaties
towards these parties with her invitation, which he claimed was a violation of
the Georgian constitution requiring the President to be neutral.[140]

The following day, after a meeting at the presidential administration,
Khazaradze acknowledged that while some issues persist, including questions
regarding the events of 20 June 2019,[141] and the Anaklia Sea Port project,
he and Gakharia are united in their goal to oust the ruling Georgian Dream
party. Khazaradze emphasized the critical need for the country to decide
between a path aligned with Russia or a future integrated with Europe.[142]

Gakharia mentioned that Khazaradze had requested additional time to clarify
his stance, indicating that negotiations were still ongoing. Gakharia
reaffirmed his party's commitment to prioritizing Georgia's democratic path.
He expressed gratitude to president Salome Zourabichvili for facilitating the
dialogue and highlighted the upcoming elections as crucial in preventing any
single party from dominating Georgian politics.[143][144][145]

On 19 September, For Georgia announced via Facebook that the negotiations
collapsed,[146] citing internal disagreements within Strong Georgia. However,
Mamuka Khazaradze, refuted this claim, saying Strong Georgia was ready to sign
the deal but was waiting for the president's invitation to finalize it. The
alliance was intended to challenge the dominance of the ruling Georgian Dream
party and the opposition UNM, potentially attracting hesitant voters. Despite
this, disagreements, particularly over the former prime minister's
controversial past and issues of equal representation on the joint party list,
led to the breakdown.[147]

On 25 September, Strong Georgia announced that former President Giorgi
Margvelashvili had joined their coalition.[148]

Overall, 27 parties were registered for the October elections.[149]

On voting day, Zourabichvili expressed hope that the election would bring an
end to "one-party rule in Georgia".[150]

## Campaign and party programmes

[edit]

### Georgian Dream

[edit]

The ruling Georgian Dream party officially announced starting a pre-election
campaign on 21 August 2024.[154] The first campaign event was launched in the
Georgian town of Mtskheta on 22 August,[155] with others following in
Ambrolauri,[156] Ozurgeti, Akhaltsikhe, Gori, Telavi and other regions.[157]
The campaign events culminated on 23 October in Tbilisi.[158] During the
campaign events of Georgian Dream, Bidzina Ivanishvili, Irakli Kobakhidze,
Mamuka Mdinaradze and its other leaders gave speeches in front of
public.[159][160]

Prior to officially launching its campaign, on 20 August, the Political
Council of Georgian Dream issued a statement, saying that the election would
be a referendum on "on war vs. peace, traditional values vs. moral
degradation, subservience to external powers vs. an independent and sovereign
state". The party urged its supporters to "put everything aside and come out
to vote", emphasizing the need for the ruling party to secure a constitutional
majority in the election to implement its long-term goals. The party presented
the objectives for which it would use the constitutional majority, which
became the main campaign issues of the party.[161]

The Georgian Dream pledged to ban the "collective United National Movement", a
term used by it to describe the former ruling United National Movement party
and other parties which have signed the Georgian Charter with the UNM,
envisaging a united strategy to form a coalition government to oust the
Georgian Dream from power. The Georgian Dream accused the United National
Movement of various "crimes against the Georgian people" during the its rule,
including "pushing Georgia into the war with Russia in 2008" and seeking to
embroil Georgia into a "second front" of the Russo-Ukrainian War. According to
the statement, the existence of the "collective UNM", "which is entirely
controlled from outside and is constantly engaged in hostility towards the
state", makes the healthy democratic process and alteration of political
forces "impossible".[161] Later Ivanishvili described the "Collective UNM" as
a "severe disease" that has plagued the country for two decades. He asserted
that the constitutional majority would enable legal action to ban "the UNM and
its affiliated parties", citing legal grounds for such a move and comparing it
to "Nuremberg Trials".[162] He further called the UNM "foreign agents who are
engaged in anti-state activities". According to Ivanishvili, only when Georgia
would replace the "Collective UNM" with the "patriotic political forces", it
would be able to conduct "truly healthy elections".[162] Prime Minister Irakli
Kobakhidze clarified that Georgian Dream intends to ban the Unity – National
Movement (UNM, European Georgia – Movement for Liberty, and Strategy
Aghmashenebeli), Coalition for Change (Ahali, Girchi – More Freedom, Droa, and
Republican Party), Strong Georgia (Lelo, For the People, Freedom Square, and
Citizens) alliances, and the For Georgia party founded by former Prime
Minister Giorgi Gakharia. Kobakhidze accused these parties of aligning with
the United National Movement and called for criminal investigations
particularily against figures like Mamuka Khazaradze of Lelo.[163][164]
Kobakhidze stated the prohibition of political parties is considered a
democratic process when there is a legal basis for it. He argued that in a
democratic state, such actions are justifiable. Kobakhidze noted that
political parties have been banned in Ukraine and Moldova, and similar
measures have received positive evaluations from the EU.[165]

On 14 September, during the campaign event in Gori, Ivanishvili blamed the
United National Movement for provoking the 2008 Russo-Georgian War and called
it the "worst crime committed by them". Ivanishvili accused the UNM of
committing "many atrocities" which he claimed were proved by evidences.
Ivanishvili claimed that the 2008 war was "a well-planned provocation from the
outside against the Georgian and Ossetian people, the purpose of which was to
split unity, destroy relations and make them exist in conditions of endless,
artificial confrontation". He stated that the 2008 war was "ordered from
outside" and executed by the "stateless agents". He pledged to hold the
"Nuremberg trials" for the UNM and also said that Georgia would need to
apologize to the Ossetian people for "the flames of fire in which our Ossetian
brothers and sisters were enveloped by the traitorous National Movement in
2008". He said that only Georgian Dream could ensure reconciliation with the
Ossetian people.[166][167][168][166] These statements of Ivansihvili proved to
be particularily controversial among the public.[179]

The second objective presented by the Georgian Dream party envisaged a further
push to adopt the Protection of Family Values and Minors bill, which the party
had already initiated in the Georgian Parliament. The bill, intended to ban
the "LGBT propaganda", has been justified by the ruling party by a necessity
of preventing the spread of "pseudo-liberal ideology" into Georgia from
outside.[161] The bill was paired with the Georgian Dream's promise to protect
the traditional values of the country. Mamuka Mdinaradze, executive secretary
of the Georgian Dream, emphasized the necessity of maintaining peace, working
to restore territorial integrity, and preserving traditional values and
independence. He emphasized that only Georgian Dream was capable of preserving
peace with Russia, and at the same time pushing for the country's European
integration. Mdinaradze also emphasized the importance of traditional values
and Christianity for the Georgian identity. Ultimately, he framed the party's
campaign promises as "surviving physically and surviving
spiritually".[180][181] On 28 September, during his campaign speech in Telavi
towards Kakhetians, Ivanishvili further accused the UNM of trying to alienate
Georgia from its national values. In particular, Ivanishvili highlighted the
"UNM's attack on Georgian viniculture", which he described as a part of
Georgian national identity. On the other hand, he claimed that the Georgian
Dream implemented state programs to restore the viniculture, winemaking
industry and traditional Russian market.[182] Speaker of Georgian parliament
Shalva Papuashvili stated that the Georgia's integration into the European
Union should be paired with the respect for the Georgian traditional values,
with him calling Georgia "one of the first cradles of European civilization"
as "the co-creators of the fact that agriculture, viticulture, Christian faith
were woven into the European identity".[183]

The third objective outlined by the ruling party revolved around reintegrating
Georgia's Russian-backed separatist regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
According to the Georgian Dream's statement, given the "dynamic development of
events", Georgia might get a chance to "peacefully restore" its territorial
integrity at "any time", therefore, "it will be necessary to amend the
Constitution of Georgia to bring Georgia's governance system and territorial
state structure in line with the new reality". According to the ruling party,
the "externally-controlled anti-state" opposition parties would not be willing
to support the restoration of territorial integrity, therefore, it would be
necessary for the ruling party to hold constitutional majority.[161][184]

There has also been a fourth issue related to "protecting Georgia's identity
and national values", however, the statement said that the issue was still
under discussion within the ruling party.[161] Later Bidzina Ivanishvili, the
founder of the Georgian Dream, elaborated that the issue was related to
"faith", with several observers speculating on a plan to make the Orthodox
Christianity a state religion in Georgia.[161][185] It was later confirmed
that the proposed amendment would focuse on designating Orthodox Christianity
as the state religion. The ruling party branded this initiative as part of
their commitment to uphold "national values and traditions," in line with
their campaign promises to ban "LGBT propaganda" and reinforce the role of the
Church.[186] In contrast, the Georgian Orthodox Church has expressed
skepticism, fearing that such a change could compromise its independence and
increase government control. High-ranking clergy members, including
Metropolitan Shio Mujiri and Metropolitan Nikoloz Pachuashvili, have raised
concerns about the potential implications of this proposal, arguing that it
could alter the traditionally independent yet cooperative relationship between
the state and the Church established by the 2002 Concordat.[187] After the
Georgian Orthodox Church (GOC) turned down the ruling party's proposal on
declaring the GOC as the state religion in Georgia, on 31 August, during the
campaign rally speech in Ozurgeti, Bidzina Ivanishvili once again addressed
the issue. He confirmed the ongoing discussions between the Georgian Orthodox
Church and the ruling party on the constitutional status of the Georgian
Orthodox Church. He said that the proposed amendment by the ruling party would
clarify the Orthodox Christianity as the "pillar of the Georgian statehood"
and emphasize its role in the country's history and present.[11]

### Unity — National Movement

UNM-led political coalition Unity - National Movement

In early January 2022, it was revealed that imprisoned former president and
leader of United National Movement (UNM), Mikheil Saakashvili, was working on
a 9-point economic plan with the UNM economist Roman Gotsiridze.[188][189] On
10 January, Saakashvili announced that the plan was completed and soon to be
presented to the public.[190]

The Saakashvili plan was ultimately released on 3 February. The plan outlined
nine theses for economic development: judicial reform, English law,
arbitration, decriminalization of economic crimes; de-oligarchization; energy
development; elimination of bureaucracy and irrelevant spending; a single tax
principle; Infrastructure and transport development; construction of the
planned city of Lazika, agricultural development and "Georgian silicon
valley".[191][192] It focused on deregulation, digitalization of public
services, reducing corruption in the court system, democratic development,
Small government, the non-interventionism in the economics and protection of
the private property as the means of attracting foreign investments to
stimulate the economic growth.[193]

The plan envisaged the creation of the constitutional commission on the
judiciary reform, decreasing time frames for case review, and limiting
corruption. It called for the unrestricted application of the English law in
Georgia on the commercial matters, expansion of the application of private
arbitrate, and decriminalization of economic crimes.[193] The plan outlined
deoligarchization as one of its main goals and proposed to ban the individuals
owning more than 5% of Georgia's GDP from joining, founding or funding
political parties.[193]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Tina_Bokuchava.jpg/220px-
Tina_Bokuchava.jpg)Tina Bokuchava presents "5 priorities" during the campaign
event in Kvareli.

The plan also envisaged Georgia's economic development model as largely
infrastructure-driven. In particular, the plan focused on building new hydro
power plants, railways, and airports in Georgia, for the country to become a
"regional logistical and transport hub". It named the bitcoins as a major
problem, citing the "Abkhaz and Georgian clans" over-exploiting electricity,
and the lack of accountability.[193]

The Saakashvili plan called for outsourcing large parts of public services to
the private sector and gradual downsizing of public sector. It also revived
the idea of building the new Lazika city within the planned time frame of 10
years, presenting it as a future "financial capital" of the country. For the
Georgian agricultural sector, Saakashvili stated that bringing new
technologies from abroad would be the only viable path for the development,
and also supported the idea of cutting subsidies to some sectors, which he
claimed would actually stimulate more entrepreneurship and growth. The plan
called for "agricultural insurance system" to be devised by the government for
stimulating agricultural development.[193]

Citing Belarus, Saakashvili presented "Georgian silicon valley" as a new
project. He called for Rustavi or some other city close to Tbilisi to become a
"tax-free zone" and privatization of enterprises there for symbolic prices
with the investment obligations.[193]

On 4 September 2024, the chairman of the UNM Tina Bokuchava presented "5
priorities" of her party and coalition partners during the campaign event in
Kvareli: European integration, increasing average income, increasing pension,
strengthening Georgian families and breaking up monopolies. In foreign policy,
the coalition promised opening accession negotiations with the European Union,
negotiating free trade and visa liberalization agreements with the United
States and scrapping Law on Transparency of Foreign Influence. In terms of
internal policy, Bokuchava promised free school meals, free housing for
students and cancelling pension loans.[194]

The Unity – National Movement prioritizes securing Georgia's membership in the
European Union. Together with its coalition partners, the party plans to
initiate EU accession talks immediately after winning the election, unlocking
access to Georgia's "14 billion euro European fund". Additionally, the party
commits to signing a free trade agreement with the United States and securing
visa-free travel for Georgian citizens to the U.S.

The party also promises to create tens of thousands of new jobs annually. A 1
billion euro EU subsidy will be allocated to agriculture, with the goal of
increasing the average national salary to 3,500 lari and setting a minimum
wage of 1,500 lari. Other key pledges include abolishing pension loans,
raising pensions to 1,000 lari, and establishing a billion-lari fund in
Mikheil Saakashvili's name to support the return of Georgian emigrants.[195]

### For Georgia

[edit]

On 8 August 2024, the For Georgia party leader, Giorgi Gakharia, went to
Batumi to meet with the people and canvass the vote. On 17 August 2024,
Gakharia officially kicked off the party's election campaign with the opening
ceremony in Zugdidi.[196]

Gakharia's promises during the election campaign included increasing the
minimum wage from 50 GEL to 950 GEL, introducing six-month unemployment
benefits and tying the increase of pensions with that of the economy.[197]

For Georgia that believes healthcare is a fundamental human right, and the
state must ensure its protection. The party plans to transition to a
compulsory universal healthcare insurance model, funded by excise taxes on
tobacco, alcohol, and vehicle imports. Primary healthcare will be
strengthened, doctors retrained, and service quality and regulated costs to
ensure access to quality medicines.

The party is committed to fast-tracking Georgia's EU integration, ensuring
sectoral benefits like access to the single market, the European Energy Union,
and application of digital policies before full membership. Additionally, the
party advocates for NATO membership without a "Membership Action Plan" (MAP),
following Finland and Sweden's model.

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/Gakharia_with_his_team.jpg/220px-
Gakharia_with_his_team.jpg)Giorgi Gakharia with the For Georgia team

Economically, the party aims to establish a European-style social state,
focused on sustainable and inclusive growth. Key priorities include employment
programs, sectoral policy development, and an export financing agency. A
4-year infrastructure project will complete gasification, water supply, and
internet access nationwide, with an emphasis on building a green economy to
safeguard natural resources.

In education, the party seeks to promote critical thinking, civic awareness,
and lifelong learning through improved quality, infrastructure, and financing.
Defense spending will rise to 2% of GDP, and military cooperation with Western
partners, especially the United States, will enhance Georgia's defense
capabilities. The depoliticization and strengthening of the State Security
Service will focus on combating hybrid threats from Russia.

The party will draft a national strategy for de-occupation and peaceful
reunification of the country, involving public and Western partner input
within one year. Governance reforms will strengthen institutions, ensure
mutual checks and balances, and promote fair, transparent elections.

Key government appointments (e.g., prosecutor general, court judges) will be
made through political consensus. Judicial reforms will focus on eliminating
corruption, including the removal of high-ranking officials who have lost
public trust. The High Council of Justice will undergo comprehensive reform to
restore integrity.

Fighting corruption is a central priority. The party promises to dismantle
elite networks that enrich themselves at the expense of citizens, ensuring
regional and municipal governments are free from corruption. Through fiscal
decentralization, municipalities will gain more authority and resources, with
anti-corruption units established locally to monitor risks.[198][199]

### Strong Georgia

[edit]

On 5 September 2024, the Strong Georgia coalition presented its election plan
called "Ilia's way"[200] to the public in Saguramo, in the vicinity of Ilia
Chavchavadze's statue. The coalition stated that it would introduce a visa
regime for Russian citizens in Georgia, restrict direct flights with Russia,
and ban selling agricultural land to Russians. It promised to push for Anaklia
deepwater port construction and to create "200 thousand new jobs", although it
did not specify what measures would be taken for this goal. It promised to
introduce a heavy gambling tax and use the increased budget funds to raise
pensions. Ana Dolidze, social democratic member of coalition from For the
People party, presented plan to increase average income and minimum wage. She
announced that these goals would be achieved in cooperation with the
"business, small and medium businesses". Levan Tsutskiridze, a leader of
Freedom Square party, focused on education reform. The coalition promised
greater European Integration, vowing to establish special ministry to push for
Georgia's accession to the EU, increase trade with the EU, and create greater
opportunities for the youth to move to the European countries through student
exchange programs.[201]

On 19 September, during the meeting with pensioners, Mamuka Khazaradze noted
that the coalition was planning to increase the taxes on gambling from 15% to
25%, citing Illinois as an example. He also called for an end to the
"exploitative practices related to pension loans and overdrafts" and promised
"proper oversight" over the pension fund.[202] A key component of Lelo's
platform is its 1,000 GEL pension plan for seniors, which Khazaradze assured
is a concrete initiative rather than a campaign slogan. "This is about
ensuring that our pensioners have the basic means to live in dignity," he
explained.[203]

The coalition plans to draft regulations aimed at separating educational
institutions from political control, promoting independence within the
education system. Proposed initiatives include developing a school nutrition
program, providing housing support for students, updating research
laboratories, promoting vocational education, and increasing the number of
kindergartens in municipalities with significant ethnic minority populations.

Additionally, the coalition intends to establish a national security system
based on NATO best practices, which will involve reforms to the National
Security Council. Plans include reinstating visa regulations for Russian
citizens and limiting the influence of Russian soft power in Georgia. To
address the needs of populations in occupied regions and promote peaceful
conflict resolution, the coalition aims to create better educational and
employment opportunities while enhancing access to prospects arising from
Georgia's candidacy for European Union membership and establishing free
economic and trade zones.

The coalition supports democratic governance, allowing all parties to operate
freely while strengthening local self-government and decentralizing power.
They plan a comprehensive review of judges through a vetting mechanism,
leading to the dissolution of the current judicial council. A new council will
be formed based on the vetting results, increasing the number of judges and
welcoming qualified professionals from outside the existing system.

A National Anti-Corruption Agency is proposed, equipped with investigative
powers and accountable to parliament. Reforms will focus on improving the
state procurement system, increasing transparency regarding offshore
companies, and subjecting any undocumented property obtained through
corruption to confiscation. The coalition argues that existing Controversial
laws hinder Georgia's European integration and do not align with national
interests, and they plan to repeal these laws upon taking office.

The coalition envisions a decentralization process that provides
municipalities and councils with increased financial resources and authority
tailored to local needs. To achieve this, they intend to strengthen the role
of councils, abolish state representative administrations, and improve the
management of local revenues for greater financial independence. They will
also review current administrative-territorial arrangements and the status of
self-governing cities altered in 2017, while reinforcing the functions of the
parliamentary committee on regional policy and self-government.[204]

### Coalition for Change

[edit]

On 25 September 2024, Nika Gvaramia, co-leader of the Coalition for Change,
announced he would not be on the coalition's candidate list, pledging to make
space for new people. The following day, it was revealed that the top spot on
the CfC's electoral list would be held by Nana Malashkhia, known as the "Woman
with the EU Flag", a symbol of the March protests.[205][206][207][208]

During the congress in Rustavi, Gvaramia addressed the audience. Gvaramia told
the representatives of small and medium businesses that they represented "the
driving force propelling this country forward" and promised them to lower
taxes, attract more investments and open avenues to the European, American,
and Chinese markets. In addition, Gvaramia addressed Georgian farmers, saying
"do not let anyone deceive you into believing that you need state assistance
every year. Do not be misled into thinking that your labour is futile or that
Russia is your only solution. The European Union, the United States, and China
offer enormous markets, which will be available to you once we take
office".[209] Gvaramia emphasized his own experience of what he called a
"political imprisonment" at the hands of the Georgian Dream government,
addressing the prison population by telling them that "I will be your
supporter in every circumstance" and promising to deliver them what they
deserve.[210]

"The future is yours"

On 17 October, Nika Gvaramia, presented the main directions of the coalition's
program to the public. Gvaramia introduced the "4-4-4 Plan", which outlines
initiatives in four key areas to be implemented within four days of the
formation of the new parliament.

According to Gvaramia, the coalition aims to prioritize the following four
areas immediately after taking office:

  * European Integration – Within four days, the coalition promises to initiate negotiations with the EU for Georgia's membership, citing the Georgian Charter, the historical choice of the country, and the will of the Georgian people. Gvaramia highlighted that Georgian politicians, along with civil society, have worked extensively on Georgia's European integration.
  * Democracy – Gvaramia affirmed the coalition's commitment to the Georgian Charter, specifically regarding the creation of a technical or transitional government, which the coalition will support. He also emphasized the importance of abolishing "Russian laws" introduced in recent years, beyond just the ones that have triggered public protests. This effort, he explained, is critical for Georgia's path towards European integration and includes broader reforms, such as court reforms and vetting processes.
  * Economy – The coalition plans to propose tax reforms within four days, which include reducing income tax to 15%, exempting small businesses (with a turnover under 400,000 GEL) from VAT, and lowering corporate tax to 5%. Gvaramia noted that these changes would benefit around 75% of businesses in Georgia, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises.
  * Education – By 2028, the coalition aims to significantly increase the education budget to adequately support all levels of education. Gvaramia outlined the creation of a "Knowledge Piggy Bank," providing 5,000 GEL in annual educational funding for every child, from kindergarten to higher education. He also mentioned the need for universities to address student housing through their own revenues, with additional state support for scientific research to reach one billion lari by 2028.[211]

### Alliance of Patriots of Georgia

[edit]

During the election campaign, the Alliance of Patriots, Conservative
Movement/Alt-Info and Georgian Idea, running on the same electoral list, held
joint meetings with the supporters throughout country. The meetings were held
in Mtskheta, Rustavi, Dedoplistskaro, Gori, Zestaponi, Batumi, Kutaisi and
others. Moreover, members of Alt-Info opened several new offices in various
regions to better communicate with the potential voters.[212][213]

Conservative Movement/Alt Info, personally sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury.

During the meetings, the parties presented several initiatives to the voters.
In terms of education, the parties promised to introduce teaching religion
into school curriculums, increase wages for teachers, free school meals and
extra-courses, and free strength training sections in all schools. In
healthcare and social protection, the parties promised universal health care,
establishing state-run pharmacies run on low prices to counteract privately
held pharmacies and monopolies, and an abortion ban. To reinvigorate economy,
the parties stated that they would issue low-percent state loans to the
businesses, protect Georgian businesses from foreign imports through high
tariffs, negotiate opening up Russian and other post-Soviet markets for
Georgian products, and nationalize "strategic resources". The parties said
that they would argue for a ban on foreign ownership of Georgian agricultural
land, an increased support for local manufacturing, as well as abolishing
taxes on land in mountainous regions to counteract their depopulation. The
parties named several legislative proposals they would push for in the
Parliament of Georgia: expanding the use of referendums to decide on public
issues, making the office of Public Defender of Georgia electable, abolishing
"gender legislation", introducing an amnesty for those imprisoned on family
violence charges, and establishing a "real anti-monopoly agency".[212]

In September 2024, the Alliance of Patriots published its electoral video clip
called "Why are we poor?". It argued that Georgia remains a developing economy
because for 30 years (since the dissolution of the Soviet Union) the country
"had been run on free market economic principles", such as the idea that if
state does not intervene in the economy, the market will "self-regulate" with
"invisible hand". Criticizing this theory, the video clip cited China and
South Korea as examples of the "most successful development models", with them
being "hybrid economies" in which the state runs and intervenes in the
"strategic sectors", while otherwise allowing free entrepreneurship. The video
clip credited this model for creating and developing "high-tech industries" in
these countries, such as automotive industry, electronics industry and etc.
The video clip also argued for increased protectionism against cheap foreign
imports to boost local economy and negotiating with Russia to open up its
market for Georgian products, which it argued would be crucial for the
economic development.[214]

### New Political Centre — Girchi

[edit]

Girchi advocates for a range of economic policies intended to redistribute
wealth, stimulate growth, and reduce poverty. One key proposal is the
distribution of state-owned property to citizens. Currently, approximately 90%
of Georgia's land and natural resources are owned by the state, including
forests, rivers, universities, and other assets. Girchi proposes to distribute
this property equally among citizens, allowing for greater individual wealth
and ownership. Another major policy is the introduction of a Universal Basic
Income of 500 lari per month for every citizen. Girchi argues that UBI would
eliminate extreme poverty by replacing a variety of social welfare programs
with a fixed monthly payment to all citizens. The system is designed to be
simple, with fewer bureaucratic processes and reduced administrative costs.

Girchi also supports a multi-currency system, allowing the use of foreign
currencies such as the US dollar and the euro alongside the Georgian lari.
This policy aims to protect citizens from inflation and exchange rate
fluctuations, giving people the choice of which currency to use for
transactions. The party proposes the return of pension funds to citizens and
the abolition of the current pension system, which it views as exploitative.
Instead of mandatory pension contributions, Girchi suggests returning
available pension funds to contributors. Girchi is also committed to reducing
taxes that disproportionately affect the poor, including excise, property, and
import taxes. The party aims to balance tax cuts without creating a budget
deficit and proposes eliminating taxes on personal imports from abroad, such
as the current 300 lari customs limit.

Another economic policy involves the redistribution of National Bank reserves
to citizens. Girchi believes the National Bank's foreign currency reserves,
accumulated through currency market interventions, should be equally
distributed among the population, providing approximately $1,200 to each
citizen. Girchi further advocates for full land ownership rights, extending
property ownership from the current two-meter depth to a greater extent. This
would give individuals full control over their land, including mineral and
resource rights. The party proposes reforms in the automobile sector,
advocating for less government interference in vehicle imports and usage.
Under this policy, citizens would not be penalized for issues like tinted
windows or lack of technical inspections as long as safety regulations are
respected.

Girchi emphasizes reducing the role of government in everyday life. The party
advocates for the dismantling of bureaucratic structures that, in its view,
perpetuate poverty. Girchi proposes offering public sector employees who
voluntarily leave their positions continued salary payments for three years,
encouraging a transition to the private sector. Girchi calls for a great
amnesty as a solution to Georgia's flawed judicial system, which still
operates under outdated Soviet-era laws. The amnesty would reduce sentences
for prisoners, with life sentences being commuted to 30 years, and
administrative fines being written off entirely.

Girchi_in_parliament.png)The Girchi MPs in parliament: Iago Khvichia, Vakhtang
Megrelishvili, Sandro Rakviashvili, and Herman Szabo.

The party also advocates for elective judges and the expansion of the jury
system. Under this system, judges of the first instance would be directly
elected by the people, rather than appointed by politicians, in order to
ensure judicial independence. Defendants would also have the right to choose
trial by jury for criminal cases with potential prison sentences of six months
or more. Girchi supports a reform of the Criminal Code, arguing that actions
without a victim or complainant should not be considered crimes. The party
seeks to humanize Georgia's criminal justice system by removing outdated or
overly punitive laws.

Additionally, Girchi proposes the electability of local police chiefs,
decentralizing control over law enforcement to local communities. This would
enable municipalities to elect their own police leaders, who would be
accountable to the local population rather than the central government. Girchi
also envisions a Central Investigation Service, similar to the FBI in the
United States, that would handle organized and serious crimes beyond the scope
of local police forces. The party calls for the liberalization of drug policy,
advocating for the decriminalization of all drugs and the regulation of
cannabis and other drugs classified by the World Health Organization as less
harmful than tobacco and alcohol.

Girchi supports the abolition of the common national curriculum, allowing
schools to determine their own teaching methods and content. The party also
advocates for legalizing home-schooling and removing state regulations from
universities, including the elimination of national entrance exams. Girchi
proposes transitioning to a professional volunteer army with higher pay and
modern equipment, as opposed to the current system of mandatory conscription.
The party supports increasing the defense budget to meet NATO standards and
advocates for building strong partnerships with Western allies to improve
military training and capability.

Girchi prioritizes NATO membership and deeper integration with the European
Union to ensure Georgia's security and sovereignty. The party also advocates
for free trade agreements with all countries and seeks to promote traditional
human rights on the international stage. Girchi emphasizes decentralization as
a key component of its platform. The party seeks to give greater autonomy to
local governments by allowing municipalities to elect their own judges and
police chiefs, and by permitting regions to set their own tax rates.

Girchi also supports lowering the parliamentary election threshold to a
natural barrier of 0.67%, arguing that this would encourage the representation
of smaller parties in parliament and foster political diversity. The party
opposes the current system of public funding for political parties, advocating
instead for parties to be funded by their supporters. Girchi views the return
of Abkhazia as one of Georgia's most challenging tasks. The party believes
this will only be achievable with strong international alliances, particularly
with the United States and the European Union. Girchi advocates for a strong
military to bolster peaceful negotiations and ensure that Georgia is respected
on the international stage. The party also seeks to create an economic and
political environment in Georgia that would encourage Abkhazian citizens to
reintegrate with Georgia.[215][216]

### Labour Party

[edit]

The Labor Party of Georgia emphasizes the importance of establishing fully
free healthcare, including diagnosis, treatment, surgery, and rehabilitation,
while advocating for state hospitals to be treated equally to private
facilities. They argue that national wealth—encompassing resources such as
gold, manganese, iron, energy, and the ports of Batumi and Poti—should be
returned to state control through nationalization, with profits distributed
among households to bolster the national budget for education, school meals,
and pensions.

In terms of energy, the party supports nationalization, asserting that a state
monopoly on electricity generation and distribution will lead to lower costs
for consumers. They propose banning the construction of dams, advocating
instead for a shift toward solar energy.

The Labor Party proposes establishing a minimum hourly wage of 10 lari,
introducing unemployment compensation, and penalizing companies for
exploitative labor practices. They also plan to raise pensions to European
standards, Additionally, the party promises a one-time assistance payment of
10,000 lari for every newborn, aiming to encourage population growth.

To support local agriculture, the Labor Party intends to restrict agricultural
imports through high customs tariffs, making domestic production more
profitable and subsidizing the harvests of various crops. They also pledge to
limit access to online casinos and betting to mitigate social issues
associated with gambling.

In education, the Labor Party commits to providing free schooling at all
levels, offering two meals a day for students, and ensuring personal computers
and internet access for children from first to twelfth grades. They aim to
facilitate job placements for students and offer scholarships for higher
education abroad, contingent upon their return to Georgia. The party also
plans to align teachers' salaries with judges' salaries, emphasizing the role
of education in reducing crime and fostering social harmony.

The Labor Party seeks to transition from mandatory military service to a
contract-based system, viewing compulsory service as a potential source of
corruption. They aim to dismantle oligarchic influence in politics, advocating
for a European-style socialism with a Nordic model to prevent wealthy
individuals from leveraging their resources for political gain. The party also
criticizes the Georgian Dream for adopting controversial laws, viewing this as
a betrayal that threatens the country's European aspirations.[217]

## Conduct

[edit]

On election day, a polling station was closed in Marneuli after footage
emerged of ballot stuffing being conducted there, during which an election
observer was attacked while trying to film the incident.[218] The CEC said
that a criminal investigation had been opened and all results originating from
the precinct would be declared invalid.[219] Two people were hospitalised
after Georgian Dream supporters attacked the offices of the UNM. Election
observers also noted cases of voter intimidation and ballot stuffing
nationwide.[220] Observers from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of
Europe said that the election took place amid a "climate of hatred and
intimidation", while European Parliament monitors accused Georgian Dream of
utilising "anti-Western and hostile rhetoric ... promoted Russian
misinformation, manipulations, and conspiracy theories" while claiming to
promote European integration at the same time.[221]

## Electoral system

[edit]

The Parliament of Georgia is composed of 150 members who are elected for a
four-year term.

As stipulated by constitutional amendments that were adopted on 26 September
2017, the 2024 election will mark the move to a fully proportional system. The
150 members of parliament are elected by closed list on a single national
constituency, with a 5% electoral threshold to be awarded seats.[222][223][5]

To determine the number of seats obtained by a political party, the number of
votes it has obtained is multiplied by 150 and divided by the sum of votes
received by all those that received at least 5% of the valid votes cast in the
elections. If the seats obtained by the political parties is less than 150,
the remaining seats are successively awarded to the political parties having
better results.[224]

On 6 February 2023, the Central Election Commission of Georgia (CEC) adopted a
decree introducing an electronic voter registration and voting system at most
of the polling stations.[225]

On 4 April 2024, Georgia's Parliament swiftly abolished mandatory gender
quotas, with 85 MPs voting in favor and 22 against. Previously, the law
required that at least one in every four candidates on a party list be a
woman. The decision was part of a deal between the ruling Georgian Dream party
and the opposition Girchi party: Georgian Dream supported Girchi's proposal to
abolish the quotas, while Girchi agreed to back the Georgian Dream candidate
for CEC Chairperson.[226][227]

On 27 August 2024, president Salome Zourabichvili signed a decree setting 26
October as the date for the parliamentary elections.[228]

On 20 February 2024, the Georgian Parliament passed amendments to the
electoral code with 81 votes in the third reading. These amendments change how
the chairman and "professional members" of the CEC are elected and abolish the
deputy chairman role, traditionally reserved for an opposition representative.
Under the new law, the Speaker of Parliament, instead of the president,
nominates and opens the competition for the election of the CEC Chairman and
professional members. Parliament requires a 3/5 majority (90 votes) in the
first round to elect candidates. If unsuccessful, a simple majority (76 votes)
can be used in the next round, with two attempts allowed. If both attempts
fail, the president gains the authority to appoint the CEC chairperson/member.
The law also stipulates that CEC members serve a full five-year term, even if
elected with a lower quorum.

The CEC is composed of 17 members: 7 nominated by the Speaker of Parliament
and appointed by Parliament, and 9 nominated by opposition parties. The
opposition and civil society organizations argue that these changes increase
political pressure on the CEC and compromise its neutrality, violating the
European Commission's conditions[229] and ignoring the Venice Commission's
recommendations against these amendments.[230]

On 30 May, the Parliament adopted further amendments to the electoral code,
including changes to the CEC's operational rules and the abolition of the CEC
advisory group, which included representatives from the Public Defender and
selected national and international experts. The ruling Georgian Dream party
justified these changes by claiming that the advisory group was not functional
due to the lack of participation from monitoring organizations.

Another significant amendment is the change in the CEC's decision-making
process. Previously, decisions required a two-thirds majority. Now, if a
decision cannot be passed in a CEC meeting, it will be subject to a revote at
the same meeting and will be considered passed if it receives a majority vote.
The ruling party defends this as an anti-deadlock mechanism.[231]

On 16 August, the CEC issued a decree requiring the chairman of each precinct
election commission to draw lots to assign duties among commission members one
week before the election, instead of on election day. Critics argue this
change gives authorities time to influence the election process and threatens
transparency. The opposition has challenged this decree in court, but the
Tbilisi City Court upheld the CEC's decision.

Independent watchdogs and opposition parties remain concerned that these
changes undermine the election process's fairness and transparency,
particularly ahead of the critical elections in October.[232]

Concerns have been raised about the voting rights of Georgian emigrants.
Despite the significant economic impact of Georgian emigrants through
remittances, their participation in national elections remains limited.
Official statistics indicate that over 125,000 people left Georgia in the past
year, while estimates suggest that the number of Georgian emigrants could be
as high as 1.6 million.

The current voting procedures for Georgians abroad are criticized for being
cumbersome, with few polling stations often located only in major cities,
making it challenging for emigrants residing in more remote areas to vote. As
a result, voter turnout among emigrants has been relatively low; for instance,
only 66,217 registered to vote in the 2020 parliamentary elections, with just
12,247 actually participating. Various stakeholders, including opposition
parties, non-governmental organizations, and president Salome Zourabichvili,
advocate for more accessible voting options, such as additional polling
stations, electronic voting, or extended voting periods. However, the
government, led by the ruling Georgian Dream party, has been slow to respond,
citing bureaucratic and logistical challenges. Critics argue that the
reluctance to reform the voting process may stem from a political strategy to
limit the influence of emigrants, who are perceived as a potentially
opposition-leaning electorate.[233][234][235] In September 2024, the CEC said
that it would open 60 polling stations in 42 countries.[236]

## Opinion polls

[edit]

Prior to the election, polls were being conducted by a number of pollsters in
Georgia. The Edison Research polls were commissioned by the pro-opposition
Formula TV, while another pro-opposition channel Mtavari Arkhi commissioned
ISSA and Savanta to conduct the polls.[237][238] The polls by Georgian Opinion
Research Business International (GORBI) were conducted on behalf of pro-
government Imedi TV company.[239][240] The IRI published its results without
allocating the number of undecided voters.

## Results

[edit]

The Georgian Dream managed to secure victory in the election, garnering more
than 53.93 percent of the vote, while the four major opposition coalitions
which agreed on not cooperating with the Georgian Dream in the parliament
through the Georgian Charter, received 37.78% in total. Georgian Dream was
strongest in the rural areas but lost the capital Tbilisi and also Rustavi to
the opposition, while being relatively close to losing other major cities as
well. Georgian Dream was strongest in the Samtskhe-Javakheti, Kvemo Kartli,
Svaneti, Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti, Guria and Adjara regions. In the
capital, it received 42% of the vote, while the four major opposition
coalitions combined received 46% plus 5.3% of the libertarian Girchi party.
Georgian Dream also dramatically lost to the opposition among in the overseas
districts among the Georgian diaspora. In Mingrelia, where the opposition
parties, particularly the UNM, were strongest in the 2021 Georgian local
elections and managed to secure victories in some districts, Georgian Dream
managed to turn the tide and won all districts. In contrast to the 2020
parliamentary election, the UNM-led Unity – National Movement coalition
declined dramatically, losing half of its votes, partly to the new Coalition
for Change alliance, which was established few months prior to the election by
former UNM members. The Lelo-led Strong Georgia coalition also managed to
improve its results due to inclusion of various small parties in its
alliance.[33] Despite this, Georgian Dream failed to attain a supermajority in
parliament that would enable them to pass amendments to the constitution
banning the main opposition parties.[241]

On 6 October, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) adopted
a resolution on Georgia at its Congress in Estoril, Portugal, condemning
"democratic regression and persecution of opposition" under the Georgian Dream
government. The resolution called for sanctions on Bidzina Ivanishvili and his
family, opposed the Foreign Agents and anti-LGBT laws, and emphasized the need
for free and fair elections and democratic reforms in line with the EU's
criteria. It also criticized "political persecution, violence against
opposition, and disinformation campaigns", urging the EU to support civil
society, strengthen election monitoring, and impose sanctions on "those
undermining democracy". ALDE also supported the initiation of EU accession
negotiations following democratic reforms.[242]

On 9 October, the European Parliament adopted the resolution "On the Decline
of Democracy and Threats to Political Pluralism in Georgia" with 495 votes in
favor and 73 against. The resolution urged the European Union to freeze aid to
the Georgian government, impose sanctions on Bidzina Ivanishvili and other
individuals responsible for the "erosion of democracy", and ensure that "anti-
democratic laws are aligned with the criteria for visa liberalization".[243]

Additionally, the draft resolution called on the Georgian government to halt
its campaign of "opposition intimidation and anti-Western disinformation,
impose sanctions on Russia, release former President Mikheil Saakashvili on
humanitarian grounds, and ensure a peaceful transfer of power based on
electoral outcomes".[244][245]

A number of MEPs made supporting statements in favor of resolution. A member
of Volt Netherlands, Reinier van Lanschot said that the upcoming elections
"will define Georgia for generations". He said that the democracy in Georgia
has been being "attacked" by the Georgian Dream party, which had been
"creating a Russian nightmare". He called the Georgian Dream "being afraid of
democracy" because "good democracy deals corrupt leaders". He stated that "a
new generation of young leaders who can build an open culture and
parliamentary democracy" in Georgia "count on our support".[246] MEP Markéta
Gregorová said that Georgia was being "taken over" by Russia and urged Europe
not to be "too late to the fight". She urged to suspend the EU candidate
status and the visa liberalisation for Georgia, while aiding the Georgians who
"to lead to fight" against the government.[247]

A number of MEPs criticized the resolution. MEP Nacho Sánchez Amor, a member
of Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, criticized the resolution on grounds that
it posed a "risk of being accused of interference" by Georgian government and
Russia, with the resolution serving as a proof.[27] MEP Thierry Mariani, a
member of National Rally, said that the resolution was aimed to influence the
Georgian elections, and possibly causing Maidan in Georgia in case of Georgian
Dream victory, while noting that only Georgians should decide their future
without the interference either from Brussels or Kremlin. Mariani said that
the resolution would destabilize the democracy in Georgia in favor of foreign
interests.[248] MEP Petar Volgin, a member of Revival party, said that Georgia
was being threatened with sanctions for refusing to be an "Euro-Atlantic
puppet" and "colony". He said that the same mechanism was working in other
countries too, including in his home country Bulgaria, to undermine a national
state and promote globalist doctrines.[249] MEP Danilo Della Valle, a member
of Five Star Movement, said that it was wrong to attempt to manipulate
Georgian elections by the EU and USA. He also spoke against "an attempt to
impose a certain geopolitical vision on countries, such as Georgia, dictated
by NATO and the United States" amid the war in Ukraine.[28]

##### Germany

[edit]

On 10 October, the German Bundestag adopted resolution called "A European
future for Georgia", initiated by the Alliance 90/The Greens and Free
Democratic Party. The resolution highlited the "authoritarian tendencies in
the country ahead of crucial elections" and called the German Federal
Government to ensure "no further progress occurs in Georgia's EU accession
process" until the Law on Transparency of Foreign Influence is in place, "take
note of any violations that could lead to targeted sanctions" against the
Georgian government and advocate for "free and fair parliamentary elections".
The CDU/CSU, Alternative for Germany and Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance voted
against, while The Left abstained.[250] In response to the resolution, AfD
initiated a motion which "opposes regime change policy in Georgia".[251]

##### Russia

[edit]

Russia claimed that there were "unprecedented attempts at Western
interference" in the election and accused Western countries of "trying to
twist Georgia's hand" and "dictate terms".[252]

###### Proposed MEGOBARI Act

[edit]

See also: Georgia–United States relations

On 11 July 2024, the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs passed
the MEGOBARI Act (Mobilizing and Enhancing Georgia's Options for Building
Accountability, Resilience, and Independence Act)[253] with a vote of 41 to 6.
Initiated by Republican Congressman Joe Wilson, the Act—named after the
Georgian word for "friend" (Georgian: მეგობარი, romanized: megobari)—addresses
"democratic and human rights issues in Georgia" and outlines specific measures
for support and oversight. The MEGOBARI Act emphasizes "the U.S. commitment to
upholding democratic values, human rights, and the rule of law" in Georgia. It
acknowledges the progress made by Georgian civil society and stresses the need
to "strengthen democracy for regional stability and U.S. interests".[254]

The Act responds to recent "democratic backsliding" by calling for increased
scrutiny of the Georgian government's actions, particularly "its ties to
Russia and other authoritarian regimes".[255] To ensure accountability, the
Act mandates several reports on issues such as "corrupt practices that support
Russian interests and evade sanctions, Russian intelligence activities, and
potential Chinese cooperation". It also includes sanctions and travel bans on
"individuals undermining Georgian democracy". A Democracy Monitoring Task
Force will be established to "oversee democratic practices", especially during
elections, to "ensure fairness".[256] Should "significant democratic progress
be confirmed", the MEGOBARI Act provides for additional U.S. assistance,
including a more preferential trade agreement with Georgia, enhanced people-
to-people exchanges and visa simplification, an economic modernization
package, and security and defense support against Russian aggression.[257]

The Act received strong bipartisan support, with committee members
highlighting its importance for "supporting Georgia's democratic aspirations
and countering Russian influence".[258][259][260] Secretary of State Antony
Blinken also announced visa restrictions for those "undermining Georgian
democracy", further demonstrating U.S. commitment.[261][262]

Georgian opposition representatives have expressed their gratitude to
Congressman Wilson for his support, praising the Acts focus on Georgia's
sovereignty, democracy, and Euro-Atlantic integration. They urged Congress and
the Senate to pass the legislation quickly and requested additional resources
and congressional visits to monitor the October parliamentary elections, given
the critical nature of this support.[263][264] Conversely, Prime Minister
Irakli Kobakhidze criticized the MEGOBARI Act, labeling it as blackmail. He
argued that the Act could harm Georgia-U.S. relations and criticized the
approach of using sanctions and threats. Instead, he called for more
constructive and pragmatic discussions to improve bilateral
relations.[265][266] The ruling Georgian Dream party issued a statement,
saying that the MEGOBARI Act constituted a "blackmail, intimidation" against
the independent Georgian policy and "especially cynical" in light of the
Georgian celebration of Independence Day two days before. The party condemned
the threat of sanctions against legislators for "voting in favor of a law" and
added that this was against the spirit of cooperation between sovereign
nations. The party rejected the possibility of following the MEGOBARI Act,
saying that "we do not intend to trade on our country's sovereignty and
security, and no blackmail whatsoever can force us to go against our
country".[267]

###### Sanctions

[edit]

On 16 September 2024, the US Department of State announced visa restrictions
for 60 "Georgian government officials and others who have undermined Georgia's
democracy and the human rights of the Georgian people". These included senior
government officials, municipal figures, business leaders, law enforcers,
lawmakers and etc.[268] Additionally, the United States Department of the
Treasury imposed financial sanctions on 4 Georgian citizens under Magnitsky
Act for "undermining fundamental freedoms". Namely, the Chief of Special Task
Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia Khareba
Kharazishvili and his deputy Mileri Lagazauri were sanctioned, along with the
leaders of the Conservative Movement/Alt-Info party Zura Makharadze and
Konstantine Morgoshia.[269]

Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze called the sanctions on Georgian
officials an "insult to Georgian state".[270] On 3 October, the US embassy to
Georgia confirmed that Bidzina Ivanishvili was not sanctioned by the US
government.[271]

On 20 September, Voice of America (VoA) reported that the U.S. State
Department and Treasury are preparing sanctions against Bidzina Ivanishvili.
According to a high-level anonymous source, this marks a significant shift, as
the sanctions package is now ready for implementation. However, it is still
unclear when these sanctions will be enacted, potentially before or after the
elections.

One official stated that Ivanishvili had taken steps to deepen ties with
Russian oligarchs and worked to increase Russia's influence in Georgia's
market, actions allegedly done under the guidance of Russian intelligence. The
sanctions would target these activities under Executive Order 14024, which
allows for sanctions related to "harmful foreign activities of the Government
of the Russian Federation."

An additional anonymous source familiar with the discussions told VoA that the
administration's efforts serve as a signal to the Georgian government,
stressing that the U.S. is serious about its concerns. "The Biden people are
trying to convey the seriousness and hope that somebody in the Georgian
government is listening in a serious way," the source explained. While it
remains unknown when the sanctions will be implemented, the necessary
preparations are in place, with the administration continuing to hope for a
shift back toward a more democratic course in Georgia.[272]

#### Post-election

[edit]

  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Flag_of_Hungary.svg/23px-Flag_of_Hungary.svg.png) Hungary: Before the election results were even published,[273] Prime Minister Viktor Orbán had already congratulated Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze on "overwhelming victory" in the election.[274] Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó wrote that "in Georgia, the election was won not by Brussels or the liberal mainstream, but by the ruling party that prioritizes sovereignty, peace, and family — placing national interests first".[275] He vowed Hungarian support for Georgia's integration into the European Union.[276] On 28 October, Orban paid a visit to Georgia,[277] which President Zourabichvili dismissed as a "political play", adding that Orbán was a "special friend" of Georgian Dream.[278]
  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg/23px-Flag_of_Russia.svg.png) Russia: On 27 October, Grigory Karasin, head of the Committee on International Affairs of the Federation Council said: "According to reports from Tbilisi, the parliamentary elections in Georgia took place in a calm atmosphere. The high voter turnout of about 58% is another indicator of civic activity. The nearly 53% of the vote received by the ruling Georgian Dream, as well as the entry of four opposition parties into Parliament, promises an active period in the country's domestic politics. We trust that it will be conducted in a predictable and civilized manner. This is in the interest not only of Georgia, but of the entire Caucasus region."[279] On 28 October, Security Council Deputy Chairperson Dmitry Medvedev called for the arrest of Zourabichvili for "calling for a coup."[280]
  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Flag_of_Turkey.svg/23px-Flag_of_Turkey.svg.png) Turkey: On 29 October, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan congratulated Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, saying: "I sincerely congratulate you on the Georgian Dream's winning the October 26, 2024 parliamentary elections with your leadership and securing the first place".[281]
  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Flag_of_Azerbaijan.svg/23px-Flag_of_Azerbaijan.svg.png) Azerbaijan: President Ilham Aliyev congratulated Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze and Georgian Dream on their victory in the election.[282] Aliyev hailed "citizens' support for stability and traditional values" in the elections.[283]
  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Flag_of_Armenia.svg/23px-Flag_of_Armenia.svg.png) Armenia: Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan congratulated Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze and the Georgian Dream party on their victory in the election.[284]
  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg.png) China: On 29 October, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian stated that the elections were held "smoothly", noting that "China always respects the choice of the Georgian people" and "sincerely hopes for stability and prosperity in Georgia". He also said that China was willing to work for pushing forward relations with Georgia.[285]
  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Flag_of_Europe.svg/23px-Flag_of_Europe.svg.png) European Union: In a joint statement on 27 October, the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell called on the Central Election Commission of Georgia to "swiftly, transparently and independently investigate and adjudicate electoral irregularities and allegations thereof".[286] The same day, the President of the European Council Charles Michel stated that the allegations of irregularities "must be seriously clarified and addressed".[287] On 27 October, a joint statement signed by the chairmen of the committees on foreign and European affairs of Germany, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Ireland, Ukraine, Poland and Canada, as well as the Third Deputy Speaker of the Riksdag of Sweden Kerstin Lundgren and MEP Rihards Kols, urged the European Union not to recognize the results, deeming them "neither free nor fair", while also reiterating support for Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili.[288][289]
  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg/23px-Flag_of_France.svg.png) France: France called for an investigation into the alleged irregularities reported in the election.[290]
  * ![Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Flag_of_the_Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/NATO_Parliamentary_Assembly_Monogram.png/20px-NATO_Parliamentary_Assembly_Monogram.png)![Council of Europe](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_Council_of_Europe.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_Council_of_Europe.svg.png)![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/European_Parliament_logo.svg/20px-European_Parliament_logo.svg.png) In a joint report published by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and its Parliamentary Assembly, the parliamentary assemblies of the Council of Europe and NATO and the European Parliament, the elections were criticized for presence of vote-buying, widespread climate of pressure and party-organised intimidation and pressure on voters, exercised particularly on public sector employees and in rural areas, raising concerns about the ability of some voters to cast their vote without fear of retribution and undermining trust in the outcome of the elections. At the same time, high engagement of Georgian citizens and presence of citizen and party observers and diversity of choices on the ballot was praised. While legal framework was also accepted as adequate for holding democratic elections, recent amendments undermined its stability and "raised concerns about the potential for misusing the changes to gain political benefit", while "effectiveness of campaign finance oversight was undermined by limited enforcement and concerns over the impartiality and political instrumentalization of the oversight body".[291][292] In its own report, the delegation of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe also reported cases of vote buying and double voting before and during elections, especially in the rural areas, while the head of the delegation Iulian Bulai stated that "the presence of cameras of the ruling party in the polling stations and people in front of polling stations tracking and possibly controlling voters led to a widespread climate of pressure and party-organized intimidation and the feeling of 'Big Brother is watching you'".[293][294] PACE's claims of double voting were supported by observers from the European Parliament.[295]
  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png) United States: On 28 October, Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that "while international and local observers agreed that election day was generally well administered, we note reports of irregularities and sporadic violence. International observers have not declared the result to be free and fair. We condemn all contraventions of international norms and join calls from international and local observers for a full investigation of all reports of election-related violations".[296] The same day State Department spokesman Matthew Miller highlighted "misuse of state resources, vote buying and voter intimidation" during the elections, adding that the Department of State joins the calls "for a full investigation". Regarding the results of the election, he stated that "at the moment we do not have a final assessment of the results, we want an investigation to be conducted. We want to see an investigation into the process".[297] On 29 October, U.S. President Joe Biden issued a statement from the White House in response to the elections in Georgia, asserting that independent, internationally recognized, and local observers deemed the October 26 elections neither free nor fair. He urged the Georgian government to transparently investigate all electoral violations and to initiate a dialogue with all political forces.[298][299]
  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4c/Flag_of_Sweden.svg/23px-Flag_of_Sweden.svg.png) Sweden: On October 28, Swedish Minister for Development Cooperation and Foreign Trade, Benjamin Dousa, announced that the Swedish government would suspend cooperation with Georgia. As one of Georgia's largest donors, Sweden has provided nearly $19 million in aid annually. Dousa stated that cooperation could be resumed if Georgia recommitted to its EU path.[300]
  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Flag_of_Canada_%28Pantone%29.svg/23px-Flag_of_Canada_%28Pantone%29.svg.png) Canada: On October 28, Global Affairs Canada released a statement regarding the parliamentary elections in Georgia, announcing a reassessment of relations and urging an investigation into the violations reported by international observers on election day in coordination with G7 and European partners. The Government of Canada also called on Georgian authorities to respect the rights of peaceful demonstrators and commended the Georgian people for their active participation in the elections.[301]
  * Edison Research, which had forecasted a win for a coalition of four opposition alliances through its exit poll, noted that the gap between its predictions and the official results went beyond typical statistical variation, hinting at possible manipulation at the local level. Following a review of the exit poll, the research organisation expressed concerns about the integrity of the reported outcomes. The findings were later echoed by competitor HarrisX.[302]
  * Europe Elects, an internationally respected election monitoring group, conducted an independent analysis of data from the central election commission and confirmed signs of irregularities benefiting the ruling party. The group highlighted a statistical pattern often seen in Russian elections, known as the "Russian tail," indicating a suspicious surge in voter distribution. This finding, coupled with other electoral violations reported by observers, led Europe Elects to conclude that the results of the 2024 Georgian parliamentary election show evident signs of tampering.[303]

### Domestic

[edit]

  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Greater_coat_of_arms_of_Georgia.svg/20px-Greater_coat_of_arms_of_Georgia.svg.png) In an interview to the BBC on 28 October, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze hailed a "landslide" victory in the election. He noted that while "irregularities happen everywhere", they were insignificant in terms of final results as "out of 3,111 polling stations, there had been incidents in just a couple of precincts". Prime Minister also added that "of course we have to address these irregularities happening on the day of the election or before", but "the general content of the elections was in line with legal principles and the principle of democratic elections". He also insisted that there is zero space for manipulation with the electronic vote-counting system that was introduced for this election. Kobakhidze accused the opposition of "lying" as he claimed they have done during the elections in 2016, 2020, and 2021.[304][305]
  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Logo_of_the_Georgian_Dream.svg/20px-Logo_of_the_Georgian_Dream.svg.png) Honorary chairman of the Georgian Dream party Bidzina Ivanishvili claimed victory on behalf of Georgian Dream.
  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Flag_of_the_President_of_Georgia.svg/20px-Flag_of_the_President_of_Georgia.svg.png) President Salome Zourabichvili publicly stated that she considers the elections to have been "illegitimate" and that the country has been a victim of a "Russian special operation". She also urged people to organize mass protests starting 28 October at 7 p.m.[306] Zurabishvili concluded her remarks by stating that "nothing can make these elections legitimate".[34] In response, parliamentary speaker Shalva Papuashvili accused Zourabichvili of creating a "coup scenario".[307] Protests were also called on by imprisoned former president Mikheil Saakashvili.[308]
  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Logo_of_the_Unity_-_National_Movement.png/20px-Logo_of_the_Unity_-_National_Movement.png) Tina Bokuchava, leader of the Unity-National Movement coalition, stated, "We do not recognize the election results, and therefore, we will not be entering parliament." She accused Bidzina Ivanishvili of orchestrating a "Russian-style operation" against the Georgian people, claiming he "usurped" their victory and disregarded their choice for a European future." We were the first to declare that yesterday's election was stolen by Ivanishvili" Bokuchava asserted." This blatant disregard for the Georgian people's will was evident in the orchestrated operation against their democratic choice."[309]
  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Ahali_party_logo.png/20px-Ahali_party_logo.png) At a briefing, Nana Malashkhia, the top candidate on the Coalition for Change's electoral list, announced the coalition's decision to renounce its parliamentary mandates, refusing to legitimize "votes stolen from the Georgian people." Malashkhia stated, "We are declining our parliamentary mandates. Today, I am officially renouncing mine."[310] Nika Gvaramia further condemned the Georgian Dream, calling it "the author of a constitutional coup." He asserted, "Under Georgian law, Georgian Dream is accountable for this. But before they face that responsibility, they must recognize the opposition's victory. We have exposed the scheme by which they stole the elections." Gvaramia underscored the coalition's unwavering stance: "Our conclusion, non-negotiable and absolute, is that Georgian Dream cannot continue to rule this country. This is Georgia, not Russia or Venezuela."[311]
  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/For_Georgia_logo_svg.svg/20px-For_Georgia_logo_svg.svg.png) Giorgi Gakharia, Chairman of the For Georgia, declared at a briefing that his party "will not legitimize the illegitimate parliament of Georgian Dream." Responding to whether they would use or renounce their parliamentary mandates, Gakharia accused Georgian Dream Chairman Bidzina Ivanishvili of "stealing the election from the people."[312]
  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Strong_Georgia.png/20px-Strong_Georgia.png) Mamuka Khazaradze, leader of the Strong Georgia, rejected the election results, declaring, "Bidzina Ivanishvili and Georgian Dream, in collaboration with Russian special services, have stolen this election from the Georgian people. We cannot and will not accept these results." Khazaradze pledged the coalition's commitment to defending the rights of their voters, stating, "We stand with our people in the pursuit of truth." He encouraged supporters, adding, "Do not lose heart. This is not over—our fight continues."[313]
  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Logo_of_the_Conservative_Movement.png/20px-Logo_of_the_Conservative_Movement.png) Pro-Russian Alt-Info, a TV channel aligned with the Conservative Movement, which was running on the Alliance of Patriots ballot, announced that they would go off air, citing unsuccessful election results.[314]
  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Girchi_Logo_%28cropped%29-1.png/20px-Girchi_Logo_%28cropped%29-1.png) Leader of the libertarian Girchi party, Iago Khvichia rejected the allegations that the elections were rigged, and that his party would join the protests against the election results, claiming that the protests would ultimately prove to be unsuccessful. He thanked his voters for supporting the party in the elections, saying that "only you were able to make a right choice".[315][_needs copy edit_] However, in a live broadcoast on their YouTube channel, leaders of Girchi party also highlighted their disappointment with the election results, saying that they were expecting much higher support for their party and crossing the electoral threshold, while not not expecting such large support for Georgian Dream and other opposition parties, adding that they would implement drastic changes in their campaigning.[316]
  * Georgian Labor Party leader Shalva Natelashvili condemned the election as fraudulent, accusing Russian special services and Bidzina Ivanishvili of deepening divisions among Georgians, fostering hopelessness, and eroding public faith in change. Natelashvili warned that this manipulation is part of a broader plan to demoralize the public, pushing Georgia toward a "Belarusization" where elections lose meaning and Georgian Dream remains unaccountable. He vowed to oppose this outcome, stating, "We will not allow it".[317]
  * ![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Federalists_%28Georgia%29_logo.svg/15px-Federalists_%28Georgia%29_logo.svg.png) The Federalists stated that "the October 26 election was neither free nor fair," asserting that Georgian Dream's results stemmed from intimidation, pressure, blackmail, bribery, and fraud. They noted that Ivanishvili's regime took advantage of opposition groups' reluctance to engage in meaningful debate against its fearmongering about war. "Our challenges have only grown more complex," they said, emphasizing that the regime acts as a tool of Russia's hybrid warfare, advancing the Kremlin's agenda to rewrite history and pull Georgia away from the free world, which will ultimately lead to severe sacrifices and a loss of sovereignty.[318]

_election_protests_28_October_2024_-_Tinatin_Bokuchava_%28UNM%29.jpg)Opposition
protest against the "rigged elections".

Protests against the election result went ahead in front of the Georgian
Parliament building along Rustaveli Avenue in Tbilisi on 28 October, during
which tens of thousands were estimated to have participated.[319][320] Another
protest was held on 4 November.[321]

On 29 October, the CEC announced a recount of ballots at five polling stations
randomly selected in each election district, equivalent to 14% of all
precincts.[322] On 30 October, the Prosecutor's Office of Georgia opened an
investigation into allegations of electoral fraud following a request by the
CEC and summoned President Zourabichvili as part of the procedure. However,
opposition parties expressed doubt over the independence of the investigation,
citing the agency's chief being appointed by the Georgian Dream-controlled
parliament.[323] Zourabichvili refused to attend the summons.[324]

The opposition announced that it was going to boycott the new parliament,
thereby depriving it of a quorum.[35]
