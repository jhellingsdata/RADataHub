General elections are due to be held in Mauritius on 10 November 2024.[1]

## Background

[edit]

At the 2019 snap election, the governing Mauritian Alliance, led by Prime
Minister Pravind Jugnauth, won re-election, securing 42 seats. The opposition
National Alliance, led by former Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam, won 17 seats.
Former Prime Minister Paul Bérenger's Mauritian Militant Movement secured
nine, and the Rodrigues People's Organisation retained its two seats.[2][3]
Jugnauth succeeded his father, Anerood Jugnauth, as prime minister in 2017,
which was met with accusations of nepotism by the opposition.[4] Observers
attributed the government's victory to economic growth and the commencement of
infrastructure projects. The opposition and civil society groups alleged
irregularities, including reports of misplaced ballots and inadequately
trained election workers.[5]

After the election, Surendra Dayal, who unsuccessfully contested Prime
Minister Jugnauth's constituency of Quartier Militare and Moka,[6] filed a
lawsuit seeking to overturn the constituency's result. Dayal claimed that
Jugnauth and the other two successful candidates, who were also from the
Mauritian Alliance, had engaged in bribery and undue influence to win their
seats. The case was dismissed on appeal in 2023.[7]

### Wire-tapping scandal

[edit]

In October 2024, a wire-tapping scandal broke out; the phone calls of numerous
journalists, politicians, civil society members and foreign diplomats were
reportedly tapped and leaked on the internet. Prime Minister Jugnauth and the
Mauritius Police Force claimed that artificial intelligence had modified the
leaked calls. Journalists affected by the tapping, however, said the calls
were authentic. One journalist alleged the government's AI claims were an
attempt to deflect attention from the scandal's fallout.[8]

Jugnauth announced an emergency committee would investigate the breach. Citing
national security concerns, the government implemented a social media ban on 1
November, to last until the day after the election. Four suspects, including a
former CEO of Telecom Mauritius, were arrested that day. The opposition
claimed the ban was politically motivated and aimed at preventing the Jugnauth
government's defeat at the polls.[9] Following widespread public uproar, the
government reversed the ban on 2 November.[10]

## Electoral system

[edit]

The National Assembly has 62 directly elected members; 60 represent 20 three-
seat constituencies, and two are elected from a constituency on the island of
Rodrigues. The elections are held using the block vote system, whereby voters
have as many votes as seats available.[11] In what is commonly known as the
best-loser system, should a community fail to win parliamentary
representation, the Electoral Supervisory Commission can appoint up to eight
unsuccessful candidates from these communities with the most votes. The
Electoral Commission divides the electorate into four communities: Hindus,
Muslims, Sino-Mauritians and the general population; the latter comprises
voters who do not belong to the first three.[12] Unless the president
dissolves the Legislative Assembly early, members serve a five-year term.[13]

Eligible candidates and voters are required to be at least 18 years old,
citizens of the Commonwealth and have resided in Mauritius for at least two
years before the nomination date.[11] A total of 1,002,857 individuals were
registered to vote in this election.[14] Public officials stationed in
Mauritius but enrolled in constituencies in Rodrigues or Agaléga and vice-
versa are eligible to apply for proxy voting.[15] Candidates have to be
proficient enough in English to participate in parliamentary procedures and
declare which community they belong to.[11][12] They also require the
nomination from at least six electors in their constituency and a deposit to
be paid, which is refunded if they obtain at least 10% of the vote.
Individuals ineligible to be contestants include those who have committed
electoral offences, have served a prison sentence exceeding 12 months, have
undisclosed government contracts or have undisclosed bankruptcy.[11]

## Parties and candidates

[edit]

The candidate nomination deadline was on 22 October.[16] A total of 73 parties
or alliances were registered to contest the election.[17] Two major coalitions
were formed before the election: Alliance Lepep, led by Prime Minister
Jugnauth and Opposition Leader Ramgoolam's Alliance du Changement. In addition
to Jugnauth's Militant Socialist Movement, other member parties of the
Alliance Lepep include Parti Mauricien Social Démocrate, Muvman Liberater,
Plateforme Militante and Muvman Patriot Morisien.[16] Parties in Alliance du
Changement included Ramgoolam's Labour Party, former Prime Minister Paul
Bérenger's Mauritian Militant Movement, Rezistans ek Alternativ and Nouveaux
Démocrates.[18] A total of 891 candidates contested the election,[19] Alliance
Lepep and Alliance du Changement fielded 60 candidates each. There were 514
independent contestants, and the remaining candidates were affiliated with
other parties or alliances.[20] As in the 2019 election, the Rodrigues
People's Organisation only contested the Rodrigues constituency.[21][22]
