Legislative elections were held in South Korea on 10 April 2024. All 300
members of the National Assembly were elected, 254 from first-past-the-post
constituencies and 46 from proportional party lists.[1][2] The two largest
parties, the liberal Democratic Party and the conservative People Power Party,
once again set up satellite parties to take advantage of the electoral system.

The election served as a "mid-term evaluation" for the Yoon Suk-yeol
administration as it approaches its third year. Additionally, there was
significant interest in whether the ruling party could surpass the constraints
of the ruling coalition, which did not secure a majority in the previous
general election, and gain the necessary momentum to govern effectively during
the remainder of its term.[3]

The election saw opposition parties, primarily the Democratic Party, retain
their majority in the National Assembly.[4] The new legislators would have
their first meeting on 30 May.[5]

## Background

[edit]

### Redistricting

[edit]

On 28 February 2024, the ruling and opposition parties reached a consensus to
redraw the electoral districts.[6] Subsequently, the National Assembly's
plenary session passed an amendment to the Public Offices Election Act,
resulting in the reformation of the electoral districts. In comparison to the
21st National Assembly elections, there was an increase of one constituency,
bringing the total to 254, while the seats for proportional representation
decreased by one, totaling 46.[7]

## Electoral system

[edit]

See also: Elections in South Korea and Legislative elections in South Korea

The National Assembly's 300 seats are elected by the following methods:[8][9]

  * 254 constituency seats are elected via first-past-the-post voting
  * 46 seats are elected by proportional representation via the additional member system and largest remainder method.

The minimum voting age is set at 18.

## Campaign

[edit]

The election was held amid several political and socioeconomic issues in South
Korea such as corruption, with President Yoon Suk-yeol of the People Power
Party facing criticism over the handling of issues involving his wife and a
former minister, and party leaders such as the Democratic Party's Lee Jae-
myung and Rebuilding Korea Party's Cho Kuk facing trials for bribery and
forgery respectively,[10] as well as rising inflation and the ongoing doctors'
strike.[11] One major talking point was an incident on 18 March when President
Yoon visited a grocery store in Seoul to check consumer prices and describing
the 875-won ($0.65) price of a green onion he found as reasonable, only for it
to emerge that the onions were being sold at a discount and that the true
price of onions was three to four times higher. The incident led to opposition
candidates bringing out green onions at campaign rallies and the hashtag
#greenonions875won becoming a trending topic on social media throughout the
election. In response, the National Election Commission banned voters from
bringing green onions to polling stations, citing concerns over "election
interference". This was in turn, widely ridiculed and led to an increase in
demand for green onion-themed merchandise.[12]

On 27 October 2023 the Justice Party and Green Party announced their intention
to form an electoral alliance and invited other left-wing parties to
participate.[13] This move was heavily criticized by Justice Party deputies
Jang Hye-young and Ryu Ho-jeong, as well as former Justice Party Youth
Committee Chair Kim Chang-in; all three believe that the Justice Party should
form electoral alliances not by ideology, but with any "third zone" party
opposed to the Democratic and People Power parties.[14]

On 2 January 2024 Lee Jae-myung was stabbed in an assassination attempt while
visiting the construction site of an airport in Gadeokdo, Busan.[15] He was
later criticised for using a sexually derogative term to describe People Power
Party politician Na Kyung-won during a criticism of her pro-Japanese
views.[16]

On 15 January 2024 the Green Party and Justice Party announced a left-wing
election coalition called the "Green-Justice Party."[17] On the same day,
Basic Income Party leader Yong Hye-in announced a pro-Democrat electoral
coalition to counter the People Power Party.[18]

Throughout the campaign the People Power Party argued that President Yoon's
government has been unable to push its reform agenda forward since taking
office in 2022 due to an uncooperative National Assembly controlled by the
opposition, while the Democratic Party described Yoon's administration as
"incompetent", accusing it of causing a socioeconomic downturn and mishandling
several controversial issues. The Rebuilding Korea Party campaigned for an
early end to Yoon's presidency,[19] with Cho Kuk pledging to turn Yoon into
"first a lame duck, then a dead duck".[20]

## Conduct

[edit]

Early voting opened on 5 April and lasted until 7 April. Among those who cast
their votes early were People Power Party leader Han Dong-hoon, who voted in
Seoul, and Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung, who voted in Daejeon.[36] At
least 13.8 million voters participated in early voting,[12] equivalent to
about 31% of the electorate.[37]

On election day, voting in 14,259 polling stations opened at 06:00 and closed
at 18:00.[37][19] Overall turnout was estimated at 67%, an increase of 0.8%
from 2020, and the highest recorded for a legislative election in South Korea
since 1992.[38]

## Results

[edit]

See also: List of members of the National Assembly (South Korea), 2024–2028

Exit polls indicated that the Democratic Party and its partner, the Democratic
Alliance of Korea, would win between 168 and 197 seats in the National
Assembly, while the People Power Party and its partner, the People Future
Party, were expected to win between 85 and 111 seats. The Rebuilding Korea
Party, which only contested proportional representation seats, was projected
to win 15 seats. Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung was projected to keep
his seat in Gyeyang B of Incheon against People Power Party candidate and
former land minister Won Hee-ryong, winning 56.1% and 42.8% of the vote
respectively.[39] The Justice Party failed to win seats for the first time
since its foundation in 2012.

Among the elected candidates in proportional representation seats was Park
Choong-kwon (representing the People Future Party), a North Korean defector
who previously worked in the North Korean nuclear weapons programme before
fleeing to the South in 2009.[40]

The election also saw the highest number of invalid votes cast for
proportional representation seats since its introduction in 2004, with the
National Electoral Commission tallying 1,309,931 such ballots, equivalent to
4.4% of votes cast.[41]

## Reactions

[edit]

Following the release of exit polls, Han Dong-hoon expressed disappointment
over the People Power Party's losses in the election.[47] Cho Kuk called the
results of the Rebuilding Korea Party's campaign the "victory of the people"
and said it showed the people can "no longer put up with the regression" of
the Yoon administration. Cho also called on President Yoon to "apologize for
the numerous misdeeds and corruption", and pledged to introduce a special
investigation bill against Han Dong-hoon once the new session of the National
Assembly is formed.[48] Lee Jae-myung expressed thanks for the Democratic
Party's showing, calling it "a great victory for our people", and said the
party will "humbly watch the people's choices to the end".[49][50]

On 11 April Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, presidential chief of staff Lee Kwan-
sup,[51] and other senior presidential advisers, with the exception of those
in charge of security issues, offered their resignations to Yoon, who pledged
to "humbly uphold" the election result and focus on improving the economy and
reforming state affairs. In a separate statement, Han Dong-hoon also resigned
as head of the People Power Party and took responsibility for its defeat in
the election.[52] That same day, Green-Justice leader Sim Sang-jung announced
her retirement from politics. Sim, who ran twice for president in 2017 and
2021, was a four-term lawmaker under various minor left-wing parties. In her
announcement, Sim assumed responsibility for the party losing all six seats
and falling below the 3% required for proportional representation.[53]

In his first public remarks since the election on 16 April, President Yoon
reiterated his acceptance of the election result and pledged to "communicate
more with a humbler and more flexible attitude, and be the first to listen
carefully to the public sentiment."[54]

## Analysis

[edit]

According to Shin Yul, a professor of political science at Myongji University,
the election results would likely lead to "extreme confrontation", stating
that it "won't be easy for people to see bipartisan cooperation".[55]

Overall, the opposition bloc (including the Rebuilding Korea Party and New
Future, which are both led by former members of the Democratic Party and are
considerably anti-Yoon)[56] did not receive enough seats to threaten the
impeachment of Yoon, which would have required a two-thirds majority, or 200
seats. They won a combined total of 189 against the government alliance and
New Reform (who are more moderately conservative and big tent) total of 111.
Nevertheless, the election result, and overwhelming majority in favor of the
governmental opposition, was enough to effectively block any government plans
going into the future. _The Diplomat_ described Yoon Suk-yeol as a "lame duck"
for his remaining three years in office.[57] Chae Jin-won of Humanitas College
at Kyung Hee University stated that "If Yoon can't find a way to work with the
opposition, there is a likelihood of impeachment, which some factions in the
ruling party may comply with for the sake of their own political futures."[58]
