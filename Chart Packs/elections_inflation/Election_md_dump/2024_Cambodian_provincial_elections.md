Provincial, municipal, district and Khan council elections took place in
Cambodia on 26 May 2024.[3][4][5]

## Background

[edit]

The Candlelight Party cannot take part in the election, because they are not
registered with the Ministry of Interior. They can, however, apply and be
approved by the ministry, allowing them to join.[4]

## Electoral system

[edit]

Only Communal Chiefs and Communal Councilors have the right to vote in
Capital, Provincial, Municipal, District and Khan Council elections every 5
years.[3]
