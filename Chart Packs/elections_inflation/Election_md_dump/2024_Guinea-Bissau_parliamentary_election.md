after being postponed from 24 November 2024.[1]

Incumbent president Umaro Sissoco Embaló dissolved the opposition controlled
parliament on 4 December 2023, saying an "attempted coup" had prevented him
from returning home from COP28 climate conference.[2]

This was the second early dissolution by incumbent president Embaló, with his
first dissolution of parliament being in 2022, leading to an opposition
victory in the 2023 parliamentary election.[3] In response to the dissolution,
parliamentary speaker Domingos Simões Pereira accused the president of
carrying out a "constitutional coup d'état."[4] Incumbent president Embaló
would go on to fire the prime minister Geraldo Martins, who was appointed by
the PAIGC-led National Assembly and instead appoint Rui Duarte de Barros by
presidential decree.[5]

## Electoral system

[edit]

The 102 members of the National People's Assembly are elected by two methods;
100 by closed list proportional representation from 27 multi-member
constituencies and two from single-member constituencies representing
expatriate citizens in Africa and Europe.[6]

## Issues

[edit]

Various opposition parties have criticized incumbent president Embaló,
accusing him of authoritarianism and wanting to establish a dictatorship.[7]
Beyond the outcome of the elections, the broader narrative in Guinea-Bissau in
2024 will revolve around the imperative of establishing and maintaining
momentum for a stable system of governance. Central to this narrative will be
the efforts to fortify institutional frameworks that serve as guardrails
against the abuse of power.[8]

According to observers, the conditions for new elections have not been met due
to organisational challenges. One major issue is the expiration of the terms
of the commission members responsible for overseeing elections. Typically,
these members would be appointed by parliament, however since the parliament
has been dissolved, there is no entity in place to facilitate the appointment
of new commission members.[7]
