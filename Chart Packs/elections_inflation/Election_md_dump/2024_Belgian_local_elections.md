All 10 provincial councils  
All 565 municipal councils  
All 8 directly elected OCMW/CPAS councils  
All 10 Antwerp city district councils  
---  
  
The 2024 Belgian provincial, municipal and district elections took place on
Sunday 13 October 2024,[1] four months after the simultaneous European,
federal and regional elections.

The local elections were organised by the respective regions:

  * Brussels with 19 municipalities
  * Flanders with 5 provinces and 285 municipalities (down from 300) 
    * In the city of Antwerp, elections were also held for its 10 districts (up from 9)
  * Wallonia with 5 provinces and 261 municipalities (one fewer) 
    * In the German-speaking Community, the elections are organised by that community rather than the Walloon Region

In the municipalities with language facilities of Voeren, Comines-Warneton and
the 6 of the Brussels Periphery, the aldermen and members of the OCMW/CPAS
council are directly elected.

As reflected in the number of municipalities above, some municipalities are
merging. One of them, Borsbeek, merged with the city of Antwerp, becoming its
tenth district.[2] In Wallonia, only Bastogne and Bertogne are merging. The
mergers take effect following the 2024 elections, when the councils of the
newly formed entities are elected.

## Brussels

[edit]

The municipal councils of the 19 municipalities were elected.

## Flanders

The Flemish decree of 16 July 2021 reformed the local electoral process,
abolishing compulsory voting in Flemish local elections.[3] Voting remains
obligatory in Brussels and Walloon local elections.

The decree also changed several election rules for Flemish municipal
elections:

  * the list vote is abolished; only preference votes count.
  * The candidate with the highest number of preferences vote of the list with the most votes has the exclusive right to form a coalition during two weeks.
  * The candidate with the highest number of preferences votes of the largest party within the formed coalition will be mayor by law.

This incentivises forming larger, joint lists instead of smaller, separate
ones.

Turnout was lower than expected, with on average 63.6% of voters casting a
ballot.[4] Eeklo had the lowest turnout and Mesen the highest.

### Municipal elections

[edit]

Antwerp

Two-term mayor Bart De Wever (N-VA) was a candidate to continue governing the
most populous city, Antwerp.[5] Main challenger was PVDA with Jos D'Haese.

Gent

Open Vld (with mayor Mathias De Clercq) and Groen (with first alderman Filip
Watteeuw [nl]) were the two main political parties since the 2018 elections.
The current governing coalition is composed of Vooruit-Groen (a joint list in
2018), Open Vld and CD&V. Open Vld and Vooruit formed a joint "Voor Gent"
list, opposing a Groen list.[6]

Mechelen

Bart Somers, mayor of Mechelen since 2001, became Flemish minister in 2019 but
returned as mayor in November 2023. He headed the "Voor Mechelen" list,
composed of the Open Vld, Groen and M+ governing coalition.[7]

## Wallonia

[edit]

The five provincial councils and the municipal councils were elected.

In eight municipalities, only one electoral list was submitted: their
candidates were automatically elected. This was the case in Herbeumont,
Houffalize, Rouvroy, Anhée, Bièvre, Vresse-sur-Semois, Limbourg and
Verlaine.[8]
