**Provincial elections** were held in the Pakistani province of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa on 8 February 2024 to elect members of the 12th Provincial
Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. On 5 August 2023, the results of the 2023
digital census were approved by the Council of Common Interests headed by
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Therefore, elections have been delayed for
several months, as new delimitations will be published on 14 December 2023, as
announced by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).[2][3] On 2 November
2023, the ECP announced, in agreement with the President of Pakistan, Arif
Alvi, that the elections would be held on 8 February 2024.[4] This election
was held concurrently with nationwide general elections and other provincial
elections.

## Background

[edit]

In the 2018 election, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) won a landslide
victory in the province by securing a two-thirds majority in the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Assembly. The PTI became the only party in the province's history
to return to government with more seats after completing a 5-year term.[5][6]

Before the 2018 elections, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) (JUI-F) and Jamaat-e-
Islami (JI) restored their electoral alliance, the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, to
counter the PTI's support but failed to make gains and in fact lost even more
seats.[7][8]

The Pashtun nationalist and leftist Awami National Party (ANP) also failed to
counter the PTI, but slightly increased their share of seats.

The conservative Pakistan Muslim league (N) (PML-N) once the most popular
party in the Hazara Division, also faced defeat and was nearly wiped out from
the region.

Due to circumstances arising after the successful motion of no confidence
against Prime Minister Imran Khan, a motion of no confidence was also filed to
remove Chief Minister Mahmood Khan from office. The motion was rejected on 11
April 2022, as 88 votes were cast against the motion to just 2 in favor.[9]

On 26 June 2022, the PTI flipped the PK-7 Swat-VI constituency in a by-
election, winning by a margin of 4,341 votes and defeated the ANP, which
enjoyed the support of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), particularly
the JUI(F) and PML(N).[10]

On 17 January 2023, Chief Minister Khan sent a letter to Governor Haji Ghulam
Ali, advising him to dissolve the Provincial Assembly. Ali accepted the advice
the next day. Elections must be conducted within 90 days of the dissolution,
meaning by or before 18 April 2023.[11][12]

After two days of talks, on 20 January 2023, the government and opposition
agreed on appointing Muhammad Azam Khan, a former bureaucrat, as the caretaker
Chief Minister.[13]

After a month of delay from Governor Ali and the Election Commission of
Pakistan (ECP), President Arif Alvi decided to unilaterally appoint 9 April
2023 as the date for the provincial election.[14]

On 1 March 2023, in a 3-2 split verdict, the Supreme Court ruled that since
Governor Ali had dissolved the Assembly, he was "in breach of his
constitutional duty" by not appointing an election date and should immediately
do so, after consultation with the ECP. As a consequence, the date appointed
by President Alvi was set aside.[15]

On 15 March 2023, Governor Ali suggested the date for the provincial election
to be 28 May 2023. However, on 24 March, in a letter to the ECP, he sought a
postponement of the elections to 8 October. Consequently, on 29 March, the ECP
announced that they would hold the provincial elections on 8
October.[16][17][18]

On 25 March 2023, Mushtaq Ahmed Ghani, the Speaker of the Provincial Assembly
of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, filed a constitutional petition and a contempt of court
petition in the Supreme Court on behalf of the PTI, over the violation of the
Supreme Court's March 1 verdict. However, no verdict had been issued.[19]

After the 2023 Pakistani protests, Pervez Khattak, the Chief Minister of the
province from 2013 to 2018, was accused of inciting other PTI members to leave
the party. Due to this, his basic party membership was terminated on 12 July
2023. Five days later, on 17 July, Khattak announced the formation of his new
party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Parliamentarians (PTI-P) and many politicians
across the province, mainly from the PTI, joined the new party. The most
notable of these politicians was Chief Minister Mahmood Khan.[20][21]

In July, 52 former MPAs of the PTI signed a letter to the ECP seeking a
"level-playing field" and alleging that the caretaker cabinet "consists almost
exclusively of nominees from parties of Pakistan Democratic Movement and their
allies like PPP and ANP". A month later, the ECP asked caretaker Chief
Minister Muhammad Azam Khan to sack ministers who were openly involved in
politics. As a result, on 10 August 2023, twenty-five members of the caretaker
cabinet had tendered their resignations to the Chief Minister. One day later,
the Governor accepted all of their resignations.[22]

### Ban on PTI from contesting as a party

[edit]

On 22 December 2023, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) decided against
letting the PTI retain its electoral symbol, arguing that the party had failed
to hold intra-party elections. On 22 December, the PTI approached the Peshawar
High Court (PHC) against the ECP's order and hence, a single-member bench
suspended the ECP's order until 9 January 2024. On 30 December 2023, the ECP
filed a review application within the PHC, and days later, a two-member bench
withdrew the suspension order as it heard the case. However, on 10 January
2024, the two-member bench had declared the ECP's order to be "illegal,
without any lawful authority, and of no legal effect. On 11 January, the ECP
challenged this ruling in the Supreme Court, and on 13 January, a three-member
bench ruled in favor of the ECP and stripped the PTI of its electoral symbol.
As a consequence of this ruling, the PTI could not allot party tickets to any
of its candidates. Therefore, all candidates of the party will be listed as
independent candidates and each will have a different electoral symbol.[23]

## Schedule

[edit]

The schedule of the election was announced by the Election Commission of
Pakistan (ECP) on 15 December 2023.[24] The by-elections for PK-22 and PK-91
constituencies, which were postponed due to an ISIS-K assassination and an
unexpected heart failure, respectively, were announced by the ECP on 14 March
and took place on 21 April 2024.[25]

## Electoral system

[edit]

The 145 seats of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly consist of 115 general seats,
whose members are elected by the first-past-the-post voting system through
single-member constituencies. 26 seats are reserved for women and 8 seats are
reserved for non-Muslims. The members on these seats are elected through
proportional representation based on the total number of general seats secured
by each political party.

## Notes

[edit]

  1. **^** 26 seats are reserved for women and 8 are reserved for non-Muslims filled through Proportional representation
  2. **^** JUI (F) did not contest the 2018 elections, as they were part of an electoral alliance called Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, which had won 13 seats and 18.01% of the vote
  3. **^** This is a column that lists the percentage of undecided voters and non-voters in certain polls that publish this data. As some polls do not publish any data whatsoever on undecided voters and non-voters, the columns with survey participants that had a preference when polled are all that is needed to reach 100%. In surveys that do include data on non-voters and undecided voters, a scaling factor is applied to the margin of error and the rest of the data (for example, if the number of undecideds and non-voters equals 20%, each party would have their vote share scaled up by a factor of 100/80 (the formula is 100/(100-UndecidedPercentage)). This is done to keep consistency between the different polls and the different types data they provide.
  4. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ This poll or crosstabulation did not include any data about undecided voters or non-voters and cut them out completely from the published results.
  5. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ Contesting as independent candidates in all constituencies
  6. **^** PK-22 election was postponed after independent candidate (Rehan Zeb Khan) was assassinated by ISIS-K. Mubarak Zeb, an independent candidate won the subsequent by-election but then vacated the seat. The ANP won the subsequent by-election.
  7. **^** PK-91 election was postponed as ANP candidate (Asmatullah Khattak) died from a heart attack on 30 January 2024.
  8. **^** Ran as a candidate of the Sunni Ittehad Council, the party that most PTI-affiliated independents joined after their election.
