A nationwide constitutional referendum was held in Moldova on 20 October
2024[1] on whether the country should amend the Constitution of Moldova to
include the Moldovan citizens' wish for European Union membership,[2] in order
to make it harder for future governments to shift the country away from its
pro-European trajectory.[3][4] The referendum occurred on the same day as the
first round of the 2024 Moldovan presidential election. The proposal was
approved and the constitution amended.

Incumbent president Maia Sandu campaigned for the "yes" side in the
referendum.[4] A narrow majority of votes were in favour of Moldova's EU
aspirations, though the referendum was described as closer than expected.
Earlier, Sandu had told Moldovans that there was "clear evidence" that
criminal groups backed by "foreign forces hostile to our national interests"
had aimed to buy off 300,000 votes.[5] The European Union meanwhile welcomed
the results and condemned the "unprecedented malign interference by
Russia".[6]

## Background

See also: Accession of Moldova to the European Union, Moldova–European Union
relations, and Moldova–Russia relations

In March 2022, following Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine, Moldova
submitted an application for EU membership.[7] That June Moldova was granted
the status of a candidate country by the European Council.[8] In December
2023, the European Council announced its decision to open accession
negotiations with Moldova.[9] Moldova set a target date of 2030 for EU
accession.[10]

President Sandu had announced her intention to seek re-election in 2023.[3]
Sandu also announced the launch of an online platform aimed at promoting the
referendum and advocating for the benefits of EU membership to the country.[3]
Observers noted she is gearing up to focus her efforts on EU integration, an
area where she and her party PAS have experienced consistent success in order
to be re-elected.[11]

In March 2024, Sandu expressed her hope that the referendum would coincide
with the presidential elections scheduled for the autumn. Sandu said; "It is
important to hold a referendum now because it is a historic occasion, awaited
for three decades. The European Union member states are more open than ever,
we have the necessary political will for this step, and our citizens want to
be part of the EU."[3]

On 21 March 2024, the Parliament of Moldova endorsed a resolution of 54-to-0
to continue the efforts to join the European Union. The declaration asserted,
"Only joining Europe can ensure the future of the country as a sovereign,
neutral, and fully democratic state". During the vote, all opposition parties
in parliament walked out.[12] On 16 May, Parliament approved the holding of
the referendum in conjunction with the presidential election on 20
October.[13][14]

### Gagauzia

On 2 February 2014, the Autonomous Territorial Unit of Gagauzia held two
referendums on European integration. In one, 98.4% voted in favour of joining
the Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia, while in the second
97.2% opposed further integration with the EU. 98.9% of voters also supported
the proposition that Gagauzia could declare independence if Moldova unified
with Romania.[15] There is concern in Gagauzia that Moldova's integration with
the EU could lead to such a unification with EU member Romania, which is
unpopular in the autonomous region.[16]

## Question

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Buletin_de_vot_Referendum_Republican_Constitu%C8%9Bional_2024_rom%C3%A2n%C4%83.pdf/page1-220px-
Buletin_de_vot_Referendum_Republican_Constitu%C8%9Bional_2024_rom%C3%A2n%C4%83.pdf.jpg)The
Romanian-language voting ballot for the referendum. There were also ballots in
Russian, Gagauz, Bulgarian, Romani and Ukrainian.

The text of the question put to the vote was:[17]

> _Susțineți modificarea Constituției în vederea aderării Republicii Moldova
> la Uniunea Europeană?_
>
> (Do you support the amendment of the Constitution with a view to the
> accession of the Republic of Moldova to the European Union?)

The options of the vote were "yes" (Romanian: _da_) and "no" (Romanian:
_nu_).[17]

## Campaign

At a meeting in Moscow on 21 April 2024, five opposition parties, namely the
banned Șor Party, the Revival Party, Chance, Victorie and the Alternative
Force for Saving Moldova, announced the formation of an alliance called
Victory to oppose EU membership and seek closer relations with Russia. The
leader of Gagauzia, Evghenia Guțul, also expressed support for the movement,
which revolves around Șor Party leader, oligarch, and convicted fraudster and
money launderer Ilan Shor. Moldovan Infrastructure Minister Andrei Spînu
called the members of the coalition "traitors" and suggested that it had been
formed "right next to the Kremlin".[18]

Moldovan authorities have accused Russian-trained groups of plotting to
destabilise the exercise. In September 2024, incidents of vandalism on the
offices of the Supreme Court of Justice of Moldova and on the public
broadcaster Teleradio-Moldova were attributed to the said groups.[19] In
October 2024, authorities announced on social media the discovery of a plot by
Ilan Shor involving vote bribery and anti-European Union propaganda, following
raids on 26 locations nationwide.[20][21] Russia denied the accusations.[22]

Security checks were strengthened at Chișinău International Airport following
an influx of passengers from Russia carrying large amounts of cash believed to
be connected with the plot.[23] On the day of the referendum, the BBC reported
that their producer overheard a voter asking an election monitor where she
would get paid for her vote, and after being questioned by the network on the
issue, she admitted to have been offered 1,000 ₽ to vote for a candidate and
option in the referendum which she did not want to disclose, money which she
did not end up receiving.[24][25]

In mid-October, Moldova accused Russia of plotting to bus in voters to polling
stations at the Moldovan Embassy in Moscow. In response, the EU imposed
sanctions on five people and one entity involved in the influence operation,
while the United States accused Russia of spending "millions of dollars" to
support its preferred parties and spreading disinformation online. The Russian
foreign ministry in turn accused Moldova of printing only 10,000 ballots for
500,000 eligible Moldovans living in Russia.[26]

On 17 October, Moldovan authorities announced the discovery of another plot in
which 100 youths were trained in Moscow, Serbia and Bosnia by private military
groups to foment civil unrest, including using nonlethal weapons to create
"mass disorder" during the election and referendum, adding that four people
had been arrested and that some of them received several thousand euros in
payments.[27]

The European Union deployed its Cyber Rapid Response Team led by Lithuania to
Moldova in order to oversee cybersecurity concerns in the election and
referendum following a request from the Moldovan Information Technology and
Cyber Security Service.[28]

## Referendum

thumbnail.jpg)Voting in a polling station on 20 October

Approximately 2.8 million ballots were issued for the referendum and the
presidential election. For the first time in Moldova, ballots were featured
not only in Romanian but also in as many as five minority languages. Thus,
2,092,641 ballots were in Romanian, 631,979 in Russian, 3,400 in Gagauz, 991
in Bulgarian, 870 in the Romani language and 115 in Ukrainian. For voters in
the pro-Russian separatist region of Transnistria, 90,000 ballots were issued,
of which 45,000 were in Romanian and the rest in Russian.[29] Voting was held
from 07:00 to 21:00.[30]

For the referendum and the election, 234 polling stations were opened abroad.
The first vote in both was cast by Ludmila Vizdoagă, a woman who at the time
had lived in South Korea for 19 years. She traveled from Seoul to Tokyo to
vote in the polling station for Japan, which was the first to be opened.[29] A
polling station was also set up in Varnița to serve voters from
Transnistria.[30] There were more than 50 polling stations in Italy, 17 in the
United States, and two in Russia (both in Moscow).[31]

The referendum was boycotted by several Moldovan political figures, including
Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova (PSRM) presidential candidate
Alexandr Stoianoglo,[32] Our Party (PN) candidate Renato Usatîi[33] and PSRM
leader and former president Igor Dodon.[34]

## Registered political parties

The Central Electoral Commission of Moldova registered the parties that took
part in the referendum campaign. Of the 15 parties officially registered by 20
September, 13 were in favor of the YES option and two were in favor of the NO
option. Some parties such as the PSRM or the Party of Development and
Consolidation of Moldova (PDCM) boycotted the referendum.[35]

## Aftermath

Analysts said ballots from the largely pro-EU diaspora were counted towards
the end, giving the "yes" campaign a last-moment push.[5][31] The "yes" option
was selected by 45.38% of voters living in Moldova and 76.96% of Moldovan
citizens living or being placed abroad.

### Instances of vote buying

President Sandu attributed the close result of the referendum to foreign
interference and described it as an "unprecedented assault on democracy",
adding that her government had evidence that 150,000 votes had been bought,
with a goal by criminal entities of 300,000 votes.[44] The European Union also
said that the two exercises had taken place "under unprecedented interference
and intimidation by Russia and its proxies".[25]

Earlier in the year, an investigation conducted by the newspaper _Ziarul de
Gardă_ revealed the existence of a criminal enterprise headed by Ilan Shor,
which received $15 million from the Russian government (the admissions were
recorded on camera); those funds were then distributed to around 130,000
people in order to bribe voters and spread disinformation against the European
Union.[20][21] Russia denied the accusations.[45][46]

A BBC producer at a polling station in Transnistria found evidence of vote
buying,[24] with a first-hand account of a woman asking an election monitor
where she could collect the cash promised to her in exchange for her vote
while refusing to tell what her vote was.[25] The election monitor Promolex
also noted instances at polling stations in Russia in which voters allegedly
received white jackets emblazoned with the words "Russia/Moldova" as well as
invitations to restaurants and internet cards as voting benefits.[47]

Four hundred Moldovan citizens were investigated for allegedly receiving money
to choose the "no" option in the referendum and vote for a determined
candidate in the presidential election. Those found guilty would have been
fined 37,000 Moldovan lei (over €1,900[48] or US$2,100[49] as of 2024), but
were given the option of not receiving punishment if they cooperated with the
authorities.[50]

The head of the Moldovan Police, Viorel Cernăuțeanu, stated on 24 October that
since September, a total of $39 million, including 15 million that month and
24 million in October, had been transferred to over 138,000 people in Moldova
through the Russian bank Promsvyazbank, which is banned in Moldova. He added
that the number of people that had benefited from this system would be much
greater as they would have received money not only for themselves but also for
members of their family. This money transfer system was believed to have
started in late spring, and was carried out through applications that people
downloaded with instructions from interactive chatbots on Telegram. This
allowed them to enter the system and benefit from transfers from the bank.
Cernăuțeanu stated that Moldovan police had documented and stopped the
activity of such bots in 97 Telegram groups.[51]

### International reactions

The European Union welcomed the results and condemned the alleged
"unprecedented malign interference by Russia".[6] European Commission
President Ursula von der Leyen praised the referendum result, saying that "In
the face of Russia's hybrid tactics, Moldova shows that it is independent, it
is strong and it wants a European future!", while the United States also noted
Russian attempts to "undermine Moldova's election and its European
integration".[52] Meanwhile, the Kremlin expressed doubt on how the 'Yes' vote
narrowly won and reiterated its denial of allegations of interference.[53]

The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe observer team said in
a statement that the constitutional referendum was well-managed and
contestants campaigned freely in an environment characterized by concerns of
illicit foreign interference and active disinformation efforts. While this
affected the integrity of the process, campaign conditions did not allow for a
level playing field among contestants, as the media coverage favoured the
incumbent and the government and there was misuse of public resources. OSCE
stated that "the election administration worked professionally and
demonstrated impartiality in their decision-making", and special co-ordinator
Lucie Potůčková praised the country "for implementing a number of reforms to
increase public confidence in the electoral system, in the context of heavy
Russian propaganda. From implementing cybersecurity measures to ensuring a
high degree of women's participation, there is much to celebrate in this
election".[54]

On 6 November, the Russian foreign ministry summoned Moldovan ambassador
Lilian Darius to complain about Moldova barring eight Russian election
observers from entering the country to monitor the referendum and presidential
elections.[55]

### Domestic reactions

Former foreign minister Nicu Popescu praised the victory of the "yes" side and
said that "even a marginal victory is still a victory", in the context of the
narrow result in favour of EU integration.[56]

In a statement on 24 October, Sandu stated that, despite the instances of vote
buying, she had rejected suggestions of annulling and repeating the elections
as "no one has the right to deny citizens a massive, honest and free
expression of their will". She further stated that, without the buying of
votes, "we would have had a clear victory for both the presidential elections
and the referendum", and also urged the Moldovan judiciary to "wake up" and
address the issue of electoral bribery.[57]
