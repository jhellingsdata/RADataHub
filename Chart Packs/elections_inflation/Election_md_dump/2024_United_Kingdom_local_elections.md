The **2024 United Kingdom local elections** took place on 2 May 2024 to choose
2,658 councillors on 107 councils in England, 11 directly elected mayors in
England, the 25 members of the London Assembly, and 37 police and crime
commissioners in England and Wales. The 2024 Blackpool South parliamentary by-
election was held on the same day.[2] These local elections were the last set
of routine elections before the general election.

This election cycle returned to its usual four-year cycle after the majority
of these elections were last held in the 2021 local elections, having been
delayed by a year from 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results were a
strong showing for the Labour Party, who finished first at the expense of the
governing Conservative Party, who finished third and suffered their worst
local election defeat since 1996, losing over 500 council seats. The Liberal
Democrats finished second for the first time in a local election cycle since
2009.[3]

## Background

[edit]

### Significance of these elections

[edit]

When local elections were held in 2021 the Conservative Party made gains,
mainly at the expense of the Labour Party. Since then, the Conservative Party
has had several high-profile political scandals and crises and has seen a
decrease in their popularity in opinion polling. This was reflected in the
poor results for the Conservative Party at both the 2022 and 2023 local
elections. As a result of the 2023 local elections, Labour became the party
with most members elected to local government for the first time since
2002.[4]

These are to be the second set of local elections held under the Elections Act
2022, a controversial voter identification law that requires[5][6] voters to
show photo ID when attending a polling station. This act also means that the
mayoral and police and crime commissioner elections will use a first-past-the-
post voting system rather than the previously used supplementary vote system.

These local elections were the last set of routine elections before the
general election. For this reason, the results were speculated by the media to
influence both the date the general election would be scheduled for and the
election strategies for each party.

Some Conservatives suggested framing the London Mayoral election as a de facto
referendum on the ULEZ,[7] which could impact parties' attitudes towards
environmental policy.

In late 2023, Labour suggested persistently high interest rates were going to
cause a surge in mortgage costs affecting 630,000 homeowners who would re-
mortgage between then and the local elections in May. They described the
situation as a "financial time-bomb" and implied this would influence the
electorate in the elections.[8]

Lord Hayward suggested that community activists and smaller parties may drain
support away from the three main parties due to the directions of those
parties and because the Liberal Democrats "are no longer the obvious choice
for voters disillusioned with the two main parties".[9]

As the elections neared, there were suggestions that Prime Minister Rishi
Sunak's leadership would be challenged if the results went poorly for his
party, particularly if the Conservatives lost either the West Midlands or Tees
Valley mayoralties.[10] Sunak quickly sought to insist to his own MPs that he
would still be the Prime Minister after these elections, even if the results
were poor for his party.[11][12]

Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden insisted that this year's elections would
be safe from cyberattacks whilst discussing Chinese state-linked hacking.[13]

### Predictions

[edit]

In March 2024, _The Observer_ reported that the Conservative Party was
expected to lose half its seats at this election, explaining that most of
these seats were won at the peak of the "vaccine bounce".[14] Conservative
Party chairman Richard Holden also cited the "vaccine bounce" as a reason to
expect these elections to be "much tougher" for his party than the last time
they were contested.[15]

Also in March 2024, Lewis Baston, a political analyst and author, posted that
his analysis showed the Conservative Party was due to lose over 50% of their
seats which are not changing boundaries. He found that of 613 seats being
defended, they would lose 328 based on the swing seen in the 2023 local
elections, but would gain eight elsewhere.[16] However, after more work, by 1
April 2024 he said he thought the Conservatives wouldn't lose half their seats
because one third of the seats up for election were not last fought in the
2021 local elections, but were actually fought in tougher elections in 2019,
2022, and 2023.[17]

Analysts Michael Thrasher and Colin Rallings also said the Conservative Party
was expected to lose half its seats at this election if a similar result to
2023 was repeated. They said the Conservatives would lose around 500 seats
while Labour would gain around 300 and the Liberal Democrats and Green Party
would both make gains.[18][19]

Sky News' Sam Coates quoted Michael Thrasher's prediction that the
Conservatives would lose around 500 seats while Labour would gain around 350,
but added that they consider Gloucester Council likely to switch directly from
Conservative to Liberal Democrat-controlled.[20]

YouGov conducted an MRP poll on 14–29 April 2024. They said their key findings
were that they "expected Labour to make significant gains across the country,
but that stories will emerge from specific local authorities which could leave
every party with pleasing news". They predicted Labour to gain control of
Hyndburn and Milton Keynes councils from no overall control, and to make
significant gains in North East Lincolnshire, Peterborough, Thurrock, and
Walsall. The Conservatives were expected to make gains in Reigate and
Banstead.[21]

## Campaign

[edit]

Aggregate seats contested by party[22] Party  | Seats   
---|---  
Conservative  | 2,512 / 2,655 (95%)  
Labour  | 2,427 / 2,655 (91%)  
Liberal Democrats  | 1,802 / 2,655 (68%)  
Green  | 1,646 / 2,655 (62%)  
Reform UK  | 323 / 2,655 (12%)  
  
Both Labour and the Conservatives were defending just under 1,000 seats each,
the Liberal Democrats about 400 and the Greens just over 100.[23]

### Liberal Democrats

[edit]

On 20 March 2024, the Liberal Democrats launched their local election campaign
in Harpenden, Hertfordshire where Ed Davey turned a giant hourglass which
revealed the words "Time's running out Rishi!".[24][25] Davey said he was
confident of toppling the "Tory Blue Wall in Surrey".[26]

### Conservative

[edit]

On 22 March 2024, Rishi Sunak launched the Conservative's local election
campaign by appearing at a bus depot in Heanor, Derbyshire, alongside East
Midlands mayoral candidate Ben Bradley.[27][28] Due to "human error" 13 of the
35 Conservative candidates were invalidly nominated for Castle Point Borough
Council seats, meaning they would not appear on the ballot.[29]

### Labour

[edit]

On 28 March 2024, Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner launched Labour's campaign
for the local elections at an event in Dudley.[30] Starmer's speech mentioned
the levelling-up policy of the government in the Black Country.[31]

### Green

[edit]

The Green Party of England and Wales officially launched its national campaign
at an event in Bristol on 4 April 2024. Co-leaders Carla Denyer and Adrian
Ramsay gave speeches at the event with a focus on affordable housing.[32][33]

### By party

[edit]

The Conservatives suffered the worst defeat at a local election by a
government since 1996,[42] losing over 450 seats. The Conservatives only
retained control of 6 out of the 107 councils; Broxbourne, Solihull, Walsall,
Epping Forest, Fareham and Harlow.[43] Their only mayoral success was the re-
election of Ben Houchen as Tees Valley Mayor.[44]

Labour won the newly created mayoralties of East Midlands Combined County
Authority and the York and North Yorkshire Combined Authority.[45][46]
Labour's Richard Parker gained the West Midlands Combined Authority from Andy
Street.[47]

BBC analysis of the 2024 United Kingdom local election results said that
Labour vote share had fallen 21 percentage points in council wards where more
than 20% of residents are Muslim and analysis by Number Cruncher Politics
found that Labour lost 33 percentage points in majority-Muslim areas.[48][49]

The Liberal Democrats gained Tunbridge Wells council[50] and Dorset Council,
resulting in the party finishing in second place ahead of the governing
Conservative Party.[51] They have added more council seats than any other
party over the last parliament, gaining more than 750 in the last five years,
largely in southern England.[52]

The Greens had their best ever local election result.[53] However, they were
unable to win a majority in Bristol City council, missing a majority of seats
by two, while staying the largest party in the council.[54]

The Workers Party of Britain won four seats: two in Rochdale,[55] one in
Manchester,[55] and one in Calderdale.[56]

Reform UK underperformed nationally but did win two seats on Havant Borough
Council.[57]

The Women's Equality Party won a seat on Basingstoke and Deane Borough
Council, their first ever borough seat in the UK in their nine-year
history.[58]

The Social Democratic Party won their third seat on the Leeds City Council in
the Middleton Park ward, defeating the sitting Labour councillor.

### Post-election vacancies

[edit]

A number of seats remained vacant following the elections resulting in a
number of post election vacancies:[59]

  * Coventry City Council, Radford ward, death of candidate.[60]

## England

[edit]

### Metropolitan boroughs

[edit]

There are thirty-six metropolitan boroughs, which are single-tier local
authorities. Thirty of them elect a third of their councillors every year for
three years, with no election in each fourth year. These councils hold their
elections on the same timetable, which includes elections in 2024. Rotherham
Metropolitan Borough Council has held its elections on a four-year cycle from
2016, so is also due to hold an election in 2024.

Due to boundary changes, some other councils which generally elect their
councillors in thirds will elect all of their councillors in 2024.

### Unitary authorities

[edit]

There are sixty-two unitary authorities, which are single-tier local
authorities. Fifteen of them elect a third of their councillors every year for
three years, with no election in each fourth year. These councils hold their
elections on the same timetable, which includes elections in 2024. Two unitary
authorities hold all-out elections on a four-year cycle that includes 2024,
and the recently established Dorset Council held its first election in 2019,
with its next election in 2024 and subsequent elections every four years from
2029.
