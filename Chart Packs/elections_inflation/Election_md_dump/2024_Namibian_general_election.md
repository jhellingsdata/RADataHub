General elections are due to be held in Namibia on 27 November 2024 to elect a
new president and members of the National Assembly.[1][2][3] They will be the
country's seventh general elections since gaining independence from apartheid
South Africa in 1990.

## Background

[edit]

Outgoing president Hage Geingob died on 4 February 2024 while receiving
treatment for cancer and was replaced by his vice president, Nangolo Mbumba,
who will serve out the remainder of his term, which expires on 21 March
2025.[4] Mbumba has announced that he has no intention of running for
president.

## Electoral system

[edit]

The President of Namibia is elected using the two-round system; if no
candidate receives more than 50% in the first round of voting, a run-off will
be held. No previous presidential votes in Namibia have gone to a second
round.[5]

The 104 members of the National Assembly consist of 96 elected members and
eight (non-voting) members appointed by the President.[6] The 96 elected
members are elected by closed list proportional representation from 14 multi-
member constituencies based on the regions. Seats are allocated using the
largest remainder method.[7]

## Presidential candidates

[edit]

As President Geingob was ineligible for reelection after having served two
consecutive terms, he selected deputy prime minister Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah to
run for president as a candidate of his party, the South West Africa People's
Organisation (SWAPO), of which she is also vice president, in 2023.[8] Upon
Geingob's death, she was appointed vice president by President Mbumba. If she
wins the election, she would be the first female president of Namibia.[9]
