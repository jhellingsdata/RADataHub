General elections were held in Rwanda on 15 July 2024 to elect the president
and members of the Chamber of Deputies.[1][2]

In an election that was criticised as unfair for its barring of serious
opposition candidates,[3][4] incumbent President Paul Kagame, in office since
2000, was elected to a fourth term (allegedly with over 99% of the vote and a
98.2% turnout) and was inaugurated on 11 August.[5]

## Background

[edit]

A referendum in 2015 approved constitutional amendments that would allow
incumbent President Paul Kagame to run for a third term in office in 2017, as
well as shortening presidential terms from seven to five years, although the
latter change would not come into effect until 2024.[6] In 2022 Kagame told
France 24 that he intended to run for president again in the 2024 election,
despite having already served three terms in office.[7]

Kagame's rule in the country has been described as authoritarian. According to
Freedom House, Kagame is an autocrat who is responsible for "surveillance,
intimidation, torture and renditions or suspected assassinations of exiled
dissidents". Human Rights Watch says that Kagame's government arrested and
threatened political opponents.[8] Freedom House considered the elections in
Rwanda neither free nor fair, citing reports of ballot stuffing, political
intimidation, blocking of opposition challengers, and other undemocratic
practices.[9]

## Electoral system

[edit]

The president of Rwanda is elected in one round of voting by plurality.[10]

The 80-seat Chamber of Deputies is elected by two methods:

  * 53 seats directly elected by closed list proportional representation in a single nationwide constituency with an electoral threshold of 5%; seats are allocated using the largest remainder method.[11]
  * 27 seats indirectly elected by local and national councils[12]
    * 24 reserved for women[11]
      * Six from the Eastern, Southern and Western provinces
      * Four from Northern Province
      * Two from Kigali
    * Two for representatives of youth
    * One for representatives of people with disabilities.

Around 9.5 million people were registered to vote.[13] Advance voting for
overseas Rwandans was held in the country's diplomatic missions on 14
July.[14] Polling on election day opened at 07:00 and lasted until 15:00,[15]
while voting for indirectly elected seats was held on 16 July.[16] Provisional
results are expected by 20 July,[17] while the final result is expected on 27
July.[18]

## Presidential candidates

[edit]

Kagame announced his bid for a fourth term on 20 September 2023 in an
interview with the pan-African Jeune Afrique magazine, saying "I am happy with
the confidence that the Rwandans have shown in me. I will always serve them,
as much when I can. Yes, I am indeed a candidate."[19] Kagame's campaign was
endorsed by member parties of Rwanda's ruling government coalition, the
Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), including the Ideal Democratic Party, the
Democratic Union of the Rwandan People, the Prosperity and Solidarity Party,
and the Rwandan Socialist Party.[20] Kagame's candidacy was finalised by the
RPF without objections at the end of its congress on 9 March 2024.[21] He was
also endorsed by the Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party on 31
March.[22]

Frank Habineza of the Democratic Green Party of Rwanda also indicated he would
run again in 2024.[23] He had previously run in 2017.

In 2019, activist Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza stated that her United Democratic
Forces party would challenge Kagame if it was officially recognised by the
government. She claimed that there were delays despite her party having the
necessary amount of registered members.[24] She said in 2023 that while
recognising Kagame's achievements while President, his greatest achievement
would be stepping aside to let a peaceful transfer of power take place.[25]
However, Ingabire had been convicted in 2010 for threatening state security
and downplaying the Rwandan genocide by asking why no Hutu victims were
included in an official memorial.[26] She was thus barred from running on 13
March 2024.[26]

On 7 June the Rwandan electoral commission confirmed Paul Kagame, Frank
Habineza and Philippe Mpayimana, an independent, as the final candidates for
the presidential election, the same three candidates as in 2017. The
applications of six other candidates, including Diane Rwigara of the People
Salvation Movement, were rejected.[27] The final list of candidates for the
presidential and parliamentary election was released on 14 June.[28] The only
three presidential candidates allowed to run were the same as from 2017, where
Kagame won with more than 98% of the vote. DW described the election as a "re-
run of the non-contest in 2017."[29] _The Independent_ wrote that the election
was "widely criticised as unfair", while Amnesty International criticised the
censorship of opposition in the race as having "a chilling effect and limits
the space for debate for people of Rwanda".[3]

## Campaign

[edit]

Campaigning was held from 22 June to 12 July.[21] Kagame pledged to continue
his policies upon reelection. Habineza criticised censorship and arbitrary
detentions under Kagame, and pledged to increase access to water and expand
mechanised farming. Mpayimana pledged to reform the mining sector to benefit
small-scale miners and expand access to loans for university students, and
said that his campaign was also aimed at promoting "political maturity" in the
country.[14]

## Conduct

[edit]

On 23 June, at an electoral rally attended by Kagame in Rubavu, a crowd crush
killed one and injured 37.[30]
