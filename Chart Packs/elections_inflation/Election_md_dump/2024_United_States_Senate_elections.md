The **2024 United States Senate elections** were held on November 5, 2024, as
part of the 2024 United States elections. 34 out of the 100 seats in the U.S.
Senate were contested in regular elections.[3][4] Senators are divided into 3
classes whose 6-year terms are staggered so that a different class is elected
every 2 years.[5] Class 1 senators faced election in 2024.[6]

26 senators (15 Democrats, 9 Republicans, and 2 independents) were seeking re-
election in 2024.[7] 2 Republicans (Mike Braun of Indiana and Mitt Romney of
Utah), 3 Democrats (Ben Cardin of Maryland, Tom Carper of Delaware, Debbie
Stabenow of Michigan), and 2 Independents (Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe
Manchin of West Virginia) were not seeking
reelection.[8][9][10][11][12][13][14] Laphonza Butler of California and George
Helmy of New Jersey, Democrats who were appointed to their current seats in
2023 and 2024, respectively, were not seeking election in 2024.[15][16]

2 special Senate elections took place concurrently with the 2024 regular
Senate elections: one in California, to fill the final two months of Dianne
Feinstein's term following her death in September 2023; and one in Nebraska,
to fill the remaining two years of Ben Sasse's term following his resignation
in January 2023.[17][13][18]

## Partisan composition

[edit]

All 33 Class 1 Senate seats, and one Class 2 seat, are up for election in
2024; Class 1 currently consists of 20 Democrats, 4 independents who caucus
with the Senate Democrats,[e] and 10 Republicans.

Election analysts consider the map for these Senate elections to be highly
unfavorable to Democrats. Democrats will be defending 23 of the 33 Class 1
seats.[21] Three seats being defended by Democrats are in states won by
Republican Donald Trump in both 2016 and 2020, while there are no seats in
this class held by Republicans in states won by Democrat Joe Biden in 2020. In
the previous Senate election cycle that coincided with a presidential election
(2020), only one senator (Susan Collins of Maine) was elected in a state that
was simultaneously won by the presidential nominee of the opposite party.[22]

## Change in composition

[edit]

Each block represents one of the 100 seats in the U.S. Senate. "D#" is a
Democratic/active senator, "I#" is an Independent senator, and "R#" is a
Republican/active senator. They are arranged so that the parties are
separated, and a majority is clear by crossing the middle.

### Before the elections

[edit]

Each block indicates an incumbent senator's actions going into the election.

## Predictions

[edit]

Several sites and individuals published predictions of competitive seats.
These predictions looked at factors such as the strength of the incumbent (if
the incumbent was running for reelection) and the other candidates, and the
state's partisan lean (reflected in part by the state's Cook Partisan Voting
Index rating). The predictions assigned ratings to each seat, indicating the
predicted advantage that a party had in winning that seat. Most election
predictors used:

  * "_tossup_ ": no advantage
  * "_tilt_ " (used by some predictors): advantage that is not quite as strong as "lean"
  * "_lean_ " or "_leans_ ": slight advantage
  * "_likely_ ": significant, but surmountable, advantage
  * "_safe_ " or "_solid_ ": near-certain chance of victory

One-term independent Kyrsten Sinema was narrowly elected in 2018 as a Democrat
with 50.0% of the vote. She left the Democratic Party in December 2022.[37]
Sinema announced on March 5, 2024, that she would not run for reelection.[38]

Prior to her retirement announcement, Sinema was considered vulnerable to
challengers from the Democratic Party due to her opposition to some of
President Joe Biden's agenda,[39] and U.S. representative Ruben Gallego
launched an early bid for the Democratic nomination, which he won with no
opposition.[40][41]

Among Republicans, Pinal County sheriff Mark Lamb and 2022 gubernatorial
nominee Kari Lake have announced their candidacies.[42][43] Lake won the
Republican primary by less than expected.

Five-term Democrat Dianne Feinstein was reelected in 2018 with 54.2% of the
vote against another Democrat. On February 14, 2023, Feinstein announced that
she would not seek reelection to a sixth term.[44] However, she died on
September 29, 2023, leaving the seat vacant. Democrat Laphonza Butler,
president of EMILY's List, was appointed by California Governor Gavin Newsom
to succeed Feinstein on October 2, 2023.[45] Butler is not running for
election to a full term, or for the final two months of the current term.[15]

There were three major Democratic candidates for the seat — U.S.
representatives Barbara Lee, Katie Porter, and Adam Schiff — along with former
professional baseball player Steve Garvey running as a
Republican.[46][47][48][49][50] Schiff was viewed as representing the
establishment wing of the Democratic Party, while Porter and Lee represent the
progressive wing.[51]

Schiff and Garvey won the non-partisan primary election which took place on
March 5, 2024, during Super Tuesday, setting up a general election campaign
between the two.[51]

Due to California's election rules, similar to the previous election for the
other seat, there will be two ballot items for the same seat: a general
election, to elect a Class 1 senator to a full term beginning with the 119th
United States Congress, to be sworn in on January 3, 2025; and a special
election to fill that seat for the final weeks of the 118th Congress.

Four-term Democrat Tom Carper was reelected in 2018 with 60.0% of the vote. He
announced on May 22, 2023, that he will be retiring, and will not run for a
fifth term.[56]

Delaware's at-large U.S. representative Lisa Blunt Rochester is running for
the Democratic nomination to succeed Carper, who endorsed her when he
announced his retirement.[57][58]

Term-limited governor John Carney was also considered a possible Democratic
candidate.[56][59] Carney announced that he is running for mayor of
Wilmington.[60]

Among Republicans, businessman Eric Hansen has announced his candidacy.[61]
