## Background

[edit]

In 2019, Umaro Sissoco Embaló won the runoff vote against Domingos Simões
Pereira, 54% to 46%. Simões Pereira disputed the results.[4] Although neither
the supreme court of Guinea-Bissau nor the parliament had given its approval
for the official swearing-in ceremony, Sissoco Embaló had organized an
alternative swearing-in ceremony in a hotel in Bissau to announce himself as
legal president of Guinea-Bissau.[5] Several politicians in Guinea-Bissau,
including prime minister Aristides Gomes, accused Sissoco Embaló of arranging
a coup d'état, although outgoing president Vaz stepped down to allow Embaló to
take power.[6]

Incumbent president Embaló dissolved the opposition controlled parliament on 4
December 2023, saying an "attempted coup" had prevented him from returning
home from COP28 climate conference.[7] This was the second early dissolution
by Embaló, with his first dissolution of parliament being in 2022, leading to
an opposition victory in the 2023 parliamentary election.[8] In response to
the dissolution, parliamentary speaker Domingos Simões Pereira accused the
president of carrying out a "constitutional coup d'état."[9] Incumbent
president Embaló would go on to fire the prime minister Geraldo Martins, who
was appointed by the PAIGC-led National Assembly and instead appoint Rui
Duarte de Barros by presidential decree.[10]

Sissoco Embaló, who is eligible to run for a second term, has given
contradictory signs about his intentions. In September 2024 and after a
meeting of the Council of Ministers, he announced that he decided not to run
after a conversation with his wife[11], but in November 2024 he stated his
intention to remain as president "for many years", beyond 2030.[12]

## Electoral system

[edit]

The President is elected using the two-round system.[13] Article 33 of Guinea-
Bissau's Electoral Law prohibits the publishing of any opinion polls.[14]

## Issues

[edit]

Various opposition parties have criticized incumbent president Embaló,
accusing him of authoritarianism and wanting to establish a dictatorship.[15]
Beyond the outcome of the elections, the broader narrative in Guinea-Bissau in
2024 will revolve around the imperative of establishing and maintaining
momentum for a stable system of governance. Central to this narrative will be
the efforts to fortify institutional frameworks that serve as guardrails
against the abuse of power.[16]

According to observers, the conditions for elections in 2024 have not been met
due to organisational challenges. One major issue is the expiration of the
terms of the commission members responsible for overseeing elections.
Typically, these members would be appointed by parliament, however since the
parliament has been dissolved, there is no entity in place to facilitate the
appointment of new commission members.[17]
