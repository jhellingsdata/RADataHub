The **2024 Sri Lankan presidential election** was the ninth presidential
election in the country’s history and was held on 21 September 2024.[3][4]
Incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe ran for re-election as an independent
candidate, making him the first sitting president to run for re-election since
Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2015.[5][6][7] Other prominent candidates included Leader
of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa, Anura Kumara Dissanayake of the NPP, and
Namal Rajapaksa, son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.[8]

The election was a three-way contest between Wickremesinghe, Premadasa and
Dissanayake. The first vote count concluded with no candidate winning a
majority. Dissanayake won a plurality of the vote with 42.31%, followed by
Premadasa with 32.76%. Incumbent president Wickremesinghe finished third,
winning only 17.27% of the vote. Since no candidate won a majority, a second
round of vote counting was held for the first time in Sri Lanka's history
under its limited ranked voting system.[9] The following day, Dissanayake was
declared the winner, winning 55.89% of the vote in the second round.[10][11]
He was inaugurated on 23 September.

The election signified a major political realignment in Sri Lanka.[12]
Dissanayake's victory was the first time a third-party candidate was elected
president. This was also the first election where neither of the top two
candidates were endorsed by the United National Party or the Sri Lanka Freedom
Party.

## Background

[edit]

The last direct presidential elections held in Sri Lanka were in 2019, where
SLPP candidate Gotabaya Rajapaksa won the election in a landslide victory,
defeating his main opponent Sajith Premadasa.[13][14]

Rajapaksa resigned on 14 July 2022 during the 2022 Sri Lankan protests.[15]
This triggered an indirect presidential election via Parliament a week later,
to elect a successor according to the Article 40 of the Constitution.[16]
Ranil Wickremesinghe, who had been appointed as Prime Minister by Rajapaksa
just two months earlier, received the most votes and was sworn in as the 9th
President of Sri Lanka on 21 July 2022.[17][18]

Article 40 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka states that "Any person so
succeeding to the office of President shall hold office only for the unexpired
period of the term of office of the President vacating office.[19] President
Wickremesinghe's term is due to expire on 17 November 2024.

Discussion surrounding the 2024 election had been a major topic since the
beginning of the year. The Election Commission stated that the election had to
be held between 17 September and 16 October, as required by the Constitution.
On 26 July, the Election Commission issued a Gazette notification declaring
that the election would be held on 21 September 2024, with nominations for
candidates to be submitted by 15 August.[20] The commission chose to hold the
election on a Saturday, stating that this would help ensure a high voter
turnout. On the same day, Ranil Wickremesinghe announced his candidacy for a
second term as president, running as an independent candidate.[3][7]

Approximately 17 million people were eligible to vote in this
election.[1][21][22]

## Electoral system

[edit]

Further information: List of presidential elections in Sri Lanka

### Type of electoral system

[edit]

The President of Sri Lanka is elected through a system of limited ranked
voting. Voters can express up to three ranked preferences for the presidency.
If no candidate receives more than 50% of all valid votes in the first count,
all candidates except the two who received the highest number of votes are
eliminated. The second and third preference votes of the eliminated candidates
are then redistributed to the remaining two candidates until one of them
secures an outright majority.[23]

In practice, this system had seen no use. Every presidential election since
the first in 1982 had resulted in a candidate from one of the major parties or
alliances winning an outright majority in the first count. Consequently, most
voters choose to mark only one candidate on their ballots, and many are either
unaware that they can rank multiple candidates or choose not to exercise that
prerogative.[24][25]

### Voting procedure

[edit]

The Election Commission outlined the voting procedure on 30 August 2024,
detailing the ranked voting system due to the multiple candidates contesting
the presidential election, ensuring voters were informed on how to cast and
submit their ballots.[26][27] Voting began at 13,134 polling stations
nationwide at 7:00 AM SLST on 21 September and closed at 4:00 PM SLST.[28]

### Postal voting

[edit]

The Election Commission announced the dates and locations for postal voting in
a media release on 29 August 2024. This facility is available only to pre-
approved officials engaged in election duties.[29][30] Postal voting was
conducted on 4, 5, 6, 11, and 12 September, strictly according to the provided
schedule.[31][32][28]

### Ballot boxes and security systems

[edit]

Due to the larger size of the ballot papers, the Election Commission has opted
to use cardboard ballot boxes instead of traditional wooden ones. These boxes
will be available in three sizes. A combination of wooden and cardboard ballot
boxes was used in the 2019 Sri Lankan presidential election and the 2020 Sri
Lankan parliamentary election.[33][34]

To further ensure security, the government imposed a liquor ban on the weekend
of 21 to 22 September and deployed more than 63,000 police officers to secure
polling stations and counting centres. It also banned the holding of victory
rallies or celebrations until a week after the results were announced.[35] A
nighttime curfew was also declared after the end of voting, which was lifted
at noon on 22 September.[36]

## Candidates

[edit]

Further information: List of political parties in Sri Lanka

By the end of candidate registration on 15 August, the Election Commission had
accepted a total of 39 applications for the presidential election, the highest
number ever recorded for a presidential election in Sri Lanka.[37] One
candidate, Mohamed Illiyas, died of a heart attack prior to the
election.[28][38] His name on the ballot was not replaced. Despite the record
number of candidates, none were female.[39][40]

One of the main reasons for the proliferation of candidates is the low
election deposit required to contest – Rs. 50,000 (US$170) for party
candidates and Rs. 75,000 (US$250) for independent candidates. These amounts
that have remained unchanged since the introduction of presidential elections
in 1982.[101][102]

Many of the minor candidates are accused of being proxy or dummy candidates
put forward by the main contenders to maximise the benefits of candidacy, such
as having two agents at every polling station, assigning counting agents,
receiving free slots on state television, and gaining general media
coverage.[103][104][105]

### Withdrawn candidates

The following candidates initially declared their intentions to contest the
election but later declined and withdrew from the campaign.

## Campaign

[edit]

### Platforms

[edit]

Ranil Wickremesinghe highlighted his administration's success in resolving
shortages of basic goods. Anura Kumara Dissanayake campaigned on a platform
promoting economic freedoms and welfare protections for the working class.
Sajith Premadasa vowed to mitigate the impact of the International Monetary
Fund's restructuring programme on the poor and promised devolved political
powers to the Tamil minority. Namal Rajapaksa pledged to reduce tax burdens,
attributing the recent economic and political crises to the COVID-19
pandemic.[21]

### Debates

[edit]

The first presidential debate was scheduled for 7 September 2024, hosted by
the March 12 Movement. Four candidates, Sajith Premadasa, Namal Rajapaksa,
Dilith Jayaweera, and P. Ariyanethiran, confirmed their participation. The
debate took place at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall
(BMICH) and was broadcast live on mainstream television and social media
platforms.[112] However, despite initial confirmations, only Dilith Jayaweera
attended the debate.[113][114]

### Election monitors

[edit]

Following an invitation from the Election Commission of Sri Lanka, the
European External Action Service (EEAS) of the European Union (EU) will deploy
an Election Observation Mission (EOM) to observe the Presidential Election
scheduled for 21 September.[115][116]

The Election Commission further announced that representatives from 12
countries have been invited to observe the upcoming election. Among those
participating are South Asian countries such as India, Nepal, Bangladesh,
Pakistan, and the Maldives, as well as a Commonwealth observer group
(COG)[117] and representatives from the Asian Election Observation
Network.[118]

### Campaign finances

[edit]

#### Expenditure cap and regulations

[edit]

The Election Commission, through a Gazette notification (Gazette Extraordinary
– No. 2397/66 on 16 August 2024), set an expenditure cap of Rs. 109 per voter
for the 2024 presidential election. As a result, each candidate is now
permitted to spend a maximum of Rs. 1.8 billion (Rs. 1,868,298,586).[119]
These regulations have been enforced under the Regulation of Election
Expenditure Act, No. 3 of 2023, which was certified on 24 January 2023.[120]

#### Candidate asset declarations

[edit]

Under the Anti-Corruption Act, election candidates must submit a Declaration
of Assets and Liabilities to the Commissioner of Elections with their
nomination papers, covering assets and liabilities up to the date the election
is announced.[121][122]

After candidates in the Presidential Election submitted their declarations to
the Elections Commission on 15 August 2024, the deadline for nomination
papers, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption
(CIABOC) obtained and published redacted versions on its official
website.[123][124]

## Aftermath

[edit]

While counting was still underway, foreign minister Ali Sabry congratulated
Dissanayake, citing his strong showing in the results.[143] The test match
between Sri Lanka and New Zealand featured a rest day due to the election. It
was the first time in sixteen years since a test match had a rest day.[144]

SJB MP Harsha de Silva congratulated Dissanayake. The Tamil National Alliance,
which had endorsed Premadasa, congratulated Dissanayake for his "impressive
win" without relying on "racial or religious chauvinism".[145] Ranil
Wickremesinghe also congratulated Dissanayake.[146]

The International Monetary Fund congratulated Dissanayake and said it was
ready to discuss the future of the economic recovery plan.[147]

Dissanayake attributed his victory to the "collective effort" of voters.[148]
He was sworn in as president on 23 September.[146] Parliament was dissolved by
Dissanayake the next day, and early parliamentary elections were called on 14
November.[149]
