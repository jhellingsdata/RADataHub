Presidential elections were held in Russia from 15 to 17 March 2024.[1][2][a]
It was the eighth presidential election in the country. The incumbent
president Vladimir Putin won with 88% of the vote, the highest percentage in a
presidential election in post-Soviet Russia,[4] gaining a fifth term in what
was widely viewed as a foregone conclusion.[5][6] He was inaugurated on 7 May
2024.[7][8]

In November 2023, Boris Nadezhdin, a former member of the State Duma, became
the first person backed by a registered political party to announce his
candidacy, running on an anti-war platform.[9] He was followed by incumbent
and independent candidate Vladimir Putin in December 2023, who was eligible to
seek re-election as a result of the 2020 constitutional
amendments.[10][11][12] Later the same month, Leonid Slutsky of the Liberal
Democratic Party, Nikolay Kharitonov of the Communist Party and Vladislav
Davankov of New People announced their candidacies.

Other candidates also declared their candidacy but were barred for various
reasons by the Central Election Commission (CEC). As was the case in the 2018
presidential election, the most prominent opposition leader,[13][14] Alexei
Navalny, was barred from running due to a prior criminal conviction seen as
politically motivated.[15][16][17] Navalny died in prison in February 2024,
weeks before the election, under suspicious circumstances.[18][19] Nadezhdin,
despite passing the initial stages of the process, on 8 February 2024, was
also barred from running. The decision was announced at a special CEC session,
citing alleged irregularities in the signatures of voters supporting his
candidacy. Nadezhdin's status as the only explicitly anti-war candidate was
widely regarded as the real reason for his disqualification, although Davankov
promised "peace and negotiations on our own terms".[20][21] As a result, Putin
faced no credible opposition.[22][23] Anti-Putin activists called on voters to
spoil their ballot. The elections saw 1.4 million invalid or blank ballots
cast, around 1.6% of all votes cast, a 45 percent increase compared to the
2018 elections.

Most international observers did not expect the election to be either free or
fair,[24] with Putin having increased political repressions after launching
his full-scale war with Ukraine in 2022.[25][26] The elections were also held
in the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine.[26][22][27] There were reports
of irregularities, including ballot stuffing and coercion,[28][29] with
statistical analysis suggesting unprecedented levels of fraud in the 2024
elections.[30]

## Eligibility

Main article: 2020 amendments to the Constitution of Russia

According to clause 3 of article 81 of the Constitution of Russia, prior to
the 2020 constitutional revision, the same person could not hold the position
of President of the Russian Federation for more than two consecutive terms,
which allowed Vladimir Putin to become president in 2012 for a third term not
consecutive with his prior terms.[31] The constitutional reform established a
hard limit of two terms overall. However, terms served before the
constitutional revision do not count, which gives Putin eligibility for two
more presidential terms until 2036.[32]

According to the new version of the Constitution, presidential candidates
must:[33]

  * Be at least 35 years old (the requirement has not changed);
  * Be a resident in Russia for at least 25 years (previously 10 years);
  * Not have foreign citizenship or residence permit in a foreign country, neither at the time of the election nor at any time before (new requirement).

(Campaign)  | Kharitonov was nominated by his party in December 2023 during the party's congress. He previously ran in the 2004 presidential election and came second with 13.7% of the vote. Kharitonov submitted documents to participate in the election on 27 December 2023 and 3 January 2024.[_citation needed_] | 9 January 2024   
  
### Rejected candidates

Individuals in this section have had their document submissions accepted by
the CEC to register their participation, and later gathered the necessary
signatures from voters. The deadline to submit documents was 27 December 2023
for independents and 1 January 2024 for party-based nominations, with the
commission already announcing the rejection of some candidates based on
alleged issues with their paperwork.[40]

Towards the deadline to submit documents, the CEC stated that 33 potential
candidates were intending to be registered as candidates (24 independents and
9 party-based nominations). The commission accepted the documents of 15
candidates.[42]

The next step was to collect signatures by 31 January 2024. Independents had
to gather 300,000 signatures from the public in at least 40 of Russia's
federal subjects to support their participation and thereby be included on the
ballot, while potential candidates nominated by political parties that are not
represented in the State Duma or in at least a third of the country's regional
parliaments had to gather 100,000 signatures.[43]

Vladimir Putin was the first to achieve this, having gathered more than half a
million signatures by 30 December; by 17 January he had gathered 2.5 million
signatures.[44][45] He was followed by Davankov, Kharitonov, Slutsky,
Nadezhdin and Malinkovich (in no particular order). Others either failed to
achieve this or withdrew from the process.[_citation needed_]

The CEC accepted the signatures of Putin, while rejecting Nadezhdin and
Malinkovich on the basis of what it described to be irregularities. Davankov,
Kharitonov and Slutsky were not required to collect signatures as they were
nominated by political parties represented in the State Duma. This confirmed
the final number of candidates at four.[_citation needed_]

(Campaign • Website)  | On 31 October 2023, Nadezhdin announced that he would run from the Civic Initiative party.[49] On 26 December he submitted registration documents to the CEC, which were registered on 28 December.[50] On 8 February 2024, the CEC announced that more than 5% of the signatures it had reviewed were invalid and therefore could not register him as a candidate.[51] Nadezhdin subsequently appealed the decision at Russia's Supreme Court.  | **Signatures collected** 105,000 / 105,000 [52] **Signatures accepted** 95,587 / 105,000[48]

## Party congresses and primaries

Congresses of political parties are held after the official appointment of
election. At the congress, a party can either nominate its own candidate, or
support a candidate nominated by another party or an independent candidate.
Twelve parties held party congresses in December 2023, at which candidates
were either nominated or endorsed.

### Other parties

At Yabloko's congress, which took place on 9 December 2023, somewhat
unconventionally, the party decided that Grigory Yavlinsky would run for
president as its nominee if he obtains 10 million signatures from potential
voters,[66] which is higher than the total number of votes Yavlinsky obtained
during his most successful run for president (5.55 million).[67] Yabloko later
stated that it would not be nominating any candidate.[68] Furthermore,
Yavlinsky only managed to gather around a million signatures.[69]

The Left Front stated that it would run a primary election between 22
candidates, but later announced it would not be holding the primary due to
threats received from the police.[70] Instead, the party called on their
"comrades in the Communist Party" to vote for one of the following to be
nominated at the party congress: Pavel Grudinin, Nikolai Bondarenko, Valentin
Konovalov, Andrey Klychkov, Sergey Levchenko, Nina Ostanina, Igor
Girkin.[_citation needed_]

## Preparation of public opinion

See also: Propaganda in Russia and Media freedom in Russia

In June 2023, a few posters advocating for Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of the
Wagner Group private military company, were noticed[71] in Krasnodar, with a
QR code to a website hinting at the 2024 election.[72] Prigozhin himself
denied any relation to such posters and "any political activity in the
internet",[72] but fuelled speculation that he was about to go into politics
after holding press conferences across Russia[71] and leading the Wagner Group
rebellion. He died in a plane crash later that year.

According to an investigation published in February 2024 by a coalition of
journals including VSquare, Delfi, Expressen and Paper Trail Media, Putin
ordered Decree Number 2016, titled "On deputy heads responsible for social and
political work of federal government agencies", on 17 February 2023. The
decree stated its aim of coordination between the Ministry of Education and
Science and other state agencies to "increase the number of voters and the
support of the main candidates" in the 2024 presidential election and other
elections. Documents from a governmental "non-profit organisation", ANO
Integration, highlighted the emphasis on increasing the number of voters and
the support of the main candidates, with turnout being used to indicate the
scale of support and opposition to Putin.[73][74]

The ANO Integration documents presented a plan to create lists of all
employees and sub-lists of opinion leaders in institutions within the
ministry's responsibility, and to monitor political attitudes and voting
preferences and "increas[e] [the employee's] level of socio-political
literacy". The documents planned for the preparation of secret instructions
for social events in which selected opinion leaders and "experts" would meet
with students and teachers in preparation for the election. Martin Kragh [sv]
of the Center for East European Studies in Stockholm described the documents
by stating, "All these documents show how little the Kremlin believes that
people might just spontaneously support the ruling party". Mark Galeotti, a
British historian, lecturer and writer, described the process as "pre-rigging"
the election in order to minimise the amount of manipulation needed in the
numbers of votes cast for Putin in the election. He stated, "The Kremlin
cannot even trust what mayors and governors tell them about the [political]
situation in their region."[73][75][76]

When asked by a BBC journalist about his electoral campaign, Nikolay
Kharitonov refused to answer why he thought he would be a better candidate
than Putin, before proceeding to praise the latter for "trying to solve a lot
of the problems of the 1990s" and consolidating the country for "victory in
all areas".[77] Shortly after filing his candidacy in December 2023, Leonid
Slutsky said he did not "dream of beating Putin" and predicted that the latter
would achieve "a huge victory".[78] Vladislav Davankov said he would not
criticize his political opponents.[79]

## Conduct

### Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine

See also: Russo-Ukrainian War and Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine

Early voting opened on 26 February and lasted until 14 March to allow certain
residents in remote areas in 37 federal subjects of Russia as well as in the
regions of Ukraine that it annexed following its invasion in 2022 to
vote.[80][81] In the latter areas, a campaign called InformUIK was set up to
encourage participation in the election, with its representatives going door-
to-door escorted by armed men to compile voter lists and collect ballots from
residences. A resident of Kherson Oblast described the elections in his area
as a "comedy show", noting that households were being visited by "two locals –
one holding a list of voters and the other a ballot box – and a military man
with a machine gun".[82]

Russian officials also used home visits by the mobile polling stations to
monitor the population and find those participating in resistance activities
or refusing to obtain Russian government documents.[83] Reports also emerged
of Russian-installed authorities coercing people to vote by withholding social
benefits and healthcare treatment, while human rights activists said at least
27 Ukrainians were arrested for refusing to vote in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia
Oblasts.[29] Despite Russian electoral laws prohibiting those without Russian
passports from voting, voters in occupied Ukraine were allowed to present any
valid identification documents, including a Ukrainian passport or driving
license.[84] In Melitopol, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, soldiers armed with machine
guns sealed off apartments being visited by mobile polling teams.[85] In one
instance, a man who fled his village near Mariupol, Donetsk Oblast, to
Ukrainian-controlled territory following the Russian invasion alleged that his
name appeared in Russian-produced voter lists and was listed as having voted
for Putin by election officials.[86]

### Efforts to promote turnout

at the United Russia congress

On the eve of the first round of regular voting on 14 March, Putin called on
citizens to vote in order to show their unity behind his leadership, saying in
a video message that "We have already shown that we can be together, defending
the freedom, sovereignty and security of Russia," and urged them "not to stray
from this path".[87]

Latvia-based Russian news outlet _Meduza_ reported that Kremlin officials
asked Russia's regional governments to secure 70% voter turnout and more than
80% support for Putin.[74][88]

Civil servants and employees at state-run companies were ordered to vote.[89]
In Omsk, officials issued 50,000 free tickets at polling stations to first-
time voters aged between 18 and 24 years of age for one Ferris wheel ride at
an amusement park. In Altai Krai, voters were to be given a chance to win
sanctioned goods and appliances such as an iPhone in a raffle, provided that
they upload pictures on VKontakte showing them at polling stations. In
Strezhevoy, Tomsk Oblast, the mayor promised free bread rolls and porridge to
voters. In Sverdlovsk Oblast, authorities set up an election day trivia quiz
about the region's history with and offered 2,000 smartphones, 45 apartments,
20 motorcycles, and 100 Moskvich cars as prizes, but said that correct answers
would not guarantee a win. In Tatarstan, officials set a music festival in
Kazan on 17 March that would be open to visitors upon presentation of a
bracelet obtained at polling stations that would also guarantee free and
unlimited access to public transportation, along with a chance to win in a
raffle with three Lada Vesta cars at stake.[90]

Reports also emerged of pressure being exerted by authorities on students and
young people to vote. Students at a construction college in Perm Krai were
ordered to vote inside the campus, with the school administration pledging to
monitor turnout using video surveillance cameras. At Tula State Pedagogical
University, students were required to submit a photo of their ballot to prove
that they voted. Its rector had also publicly endorsed Putin. At Voronezh
State Pedagogical University, students said they were required to inform
authorities about who they were voting for.[91]

### Regular voting

Vladimir_Putin_votes_in_the_2024_Russian_presidential_election.jpg)Putin voted
in the Russian presidential election online.

On the regular election days, polls opened at 08:00 local time in Kamchatka
Krai on 15 March and are expected to close at 20:00 local time in Kaliningrad
Oblast on 17 March.[87] Independent watchdogs were prevented from observing
the conduct of the election, as only registered candidates and state-backed
advisory bodies were allowed to send observers to polling stations. The
independent election monitor Golos described the election as the "most vapid"
since the 2000 election, noting that campaigning was "practically
unnoticeable" and that authorities were "doing everything" to prevent people
noticing that an election was taking place while state media provided less
airtime to the election compared to 2018. It also described Putin's campaign
as disguised by his activities as president, while his registered opponents
were "demonstrably passive".[92]

On 15 March, the Kremlin published images of Putin casting his vote online
using a computer in his office.[93] On the morning of the same day, the online
voting system went down temporarily, with Golos and other independent
electoral observers attributing the outage to the traffic generated by votes
coming from workplaces.[94]

## Allegations of fraud

### Statistical analyses

According to a _Novaya Gazeta_ investigation using a method proposed by
mathematician Sergey Shpilkin [ru], around 22 million of the non-online
(polling booth) votes for Putin were falsified, out of 64.7 million non-online
votes for Putin in total. _Novaya Gazeta_ described the analysis showing
"record levels of fraud even for a Russian presidential election".[95][96]

_Meduza_ carried out statistical analyses on the official results released by
the CEC. Based on scatter plots of the vote percentage for Putin compared to
turnout, a tail in which voter turnout visually correlates to Putin support,
which appeared weakly in earlier Russian presidential elections, was found by
_Meduza_ to completely dominate in 2024. "Churov's saw", a statistical effect
interpreted as fraudulent in which sharp peaks at round numbers appear in
voter turnout and percentage votes for Putin, was found by _Meduza_ to have
strengthened in the 2024 election, with _Meduza_ arguing that the number of
polling stations with likely fraud became the majority in 2024, while earlier
the fraction of fraudulent polling stations had been a minority. Overall,
_Meduza_ stated that the 2024 presidential election "was almost certainly the
most fraudulent" in "modern Russian history", and that the "sheer magnitude of
fraud eclipses that of 2018".[30]

### Other incidents of fraud

On 16 March, Golos released a video on social media appearing to show staff at
a polling station in Krasnodar doing ballot stuffing.[97] It also said that it
had received reports of attempts to inspect filled-out ballots before they
were cast, and one instance in which police demanded a ballot box be opened to
remove a ballot.[98] Thermochromic ink that disappears when heated was also
allegedly used in Kursk and Rostov-on-Don on 15 March.[99] The usage of such
ink was previously reported during the 2021 regional elections in Khimki.[100]
Overall, Golos described the 2024 election as an "imitation", adding that it
had not previously observed "a presidential campaign that fell so short of
constitutional standards".[101]

## Incidents

### Attacks by Ukrainian and other armed groups

Attacks have been launched against Russian electoral institutions in occupied
areas of Ukraine. On the first day of early voting on 27 February 2024, two
bombs were detonated at the local offices of the United Russia party and near
a polling station in Nova Kakhovka, Kherson Oblast.[82] On 6 March, a local
official of the Russian Central Election Commission in Berdiansk, Zaporizhzhia
Oblast, was killed by a car bomb, according to Ukrainian officials.[102] When
asked about the killing, the Ukrainian-appointed governor of the oblast, Ivan
Fedorov, attributed the attack to "our resistance", adding that they were
linked to Ukrainian secret services and that "it is abnormal when our citizens
collaborate with Russians".[82] On 15 March, an improvised explosive device
was detonated inside a trash can in front of a polling station in Skadovsk,
Kherson Oblast,[103] injuring five Russian soldiers.[104] On 16 March, the
Russian-installed governor of Kherson Oblast, Volodymyr Saldo claimed that one
person was killed and four others were injured in a Ukrainian drone strike in
Kakhovka, which he claimed was an attempt to disrupt voting, while TASS
reported that a Ukrainian drone struck a polling station in Zaporizhzhia
Oblast.[28]

During an incursion into Kursk and Belgorod Oblasts on 12 March, the Sibir
Battalion, an armed Russian opposition group based in Ukraine, published a
video condemning the elections, saying that "Ballots and polling stations in
this case are fiction."[105] A member of the Freedom of Russia Legion, which
also participated in the attacks, acknowledged that they were "timed with the
so-called elections" and referred to it as a "voting method".[106] Putin also
described the incursion as an attempt to "disrupt" the election and "interfere
with the normal process of expressing the will of citizens".[107] Throughout
the election, the border city of Belgorod was subjected to shelling and rocket
attacks by Ukraine, killing two people in what most analysts believed to be an
attempt to disrupt the vote and incite discontent against Putin by convincing
Russians of his responsibility in bringing the war on Ukraine to Russian soil
by launching the invasion in the first place, although the high turnout of 78
percent in Belgorod Oblast suggested that the strategy had led to increased
support for Putin.[108]

On 25 March, the independent news outlet Mediazona reported that the Federal
Security Service had arrested three people on suspicion of plotting an arson
attack against a Putin campaign office in Barnaul, Altai Krai, prior to the
election. One of the suspects was said to have been in contact with an
"unidentified terrorist organization".[109]

### Incidents involving civilians

During regular polling, several election-related incidents were reported
across the country, resulting in at least 13 arrests, seven of which were for
pouring liquid substances on ballot boxes and four for committing acts of
arson in polling stations,[110] one of which involved a woman in Saint
Petersburg who was arrested for throwing a molotov cocktail at a school
hosting two polling stations after having allegedly been promised a financial
incentive by a "Ukrainian Telegram channel".[111] A voting booth was also set
on fire in Moscow.[112] In Podolsk, Moscow Oblast, a voter was charged with
"discrediting the Russian army" and fined 30,000 rubles ($342) after spoiling
her ballot by writing an unspecified message.[97] A voter in Saint Petersburg
was ordered arrested on similar charges after writing the words "No to War" on
her ballot.[113] Some voters uploaded images of them spoiling their ballots by
writing messages such as "killer and thief" and "waiting for you in The
Hague", a reference to the arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal
Court against Putin over war crimes in Ukraine.[114]

On 17 March, a Moldovan national was arrested after throwing two molotov
cocktails at the grounds of the Russian embassy [ro; ru] in Chișinău, which
was being used as a polling station for Russian nationals in Moldova. Moldovan
police said that the man, who also claimed to be carrying Russian citizenship,
"justified his action by some dissatisfaction he has with the actions of the
Russian authorities".[115]

In response to the attacks on polling stations, former president and deputy
chair of the Security Council of Russia Dmitry Medvedev called for charges of
treason to be filed against those who vandalize polling stations for
attempting to derail the vote amid the fighting in Ukraine.[114]

### Cyberattacks

On 16 March, the United Russia party said its website was targeted by a
cyberattack.[116]

results abroad.

The CEC said that 388,791 Russians cast their ballots from abroad.[119]

In contrast to the official exit polls and results of the election both inside
and outside of Russia, unofficial exit polls of the votes cast abroad showed a
much poorer performance for Putin. According to the Vote Abroad project,[120]
Davankov won a plurality of the votes at most of the voting stations abroad,
earning his best result in Trabzon. However, Putin secured pluralities in
Genoa, Rome, Nicosia, Chișinău, Ankara, Samarkand and Bonn. He also won 59% in
Athens, making it his best performance abroad.[121] Conversely, he got his
worst showing in The Hague, with just 2% of the vote.[122] Putin won 3% in
Poland, Serbia and Montenegro, and 8% in Almaty, Kazakhstan.[123]

According to the Vote Abroad project, Putin was also voted for by 4% of
Russians living in Lithuania and the Czech Republic, 5% in Istanbul, Turkey,
6% in Argentina and the United Kingdom, 7% in Austria, Ireland and Slovakia,
8% in Estonia, Denmark and Yerevan, Armenia, 9% in Portugal, 10% in Thailand,
Finland and Berlin, Germany, 11% in Madrid, Spain and Paris, France, 13% in
Norway, 14% in Sweden and Hungary, 15% in Vietnam and the United States, 16%
in Tel Aviv, Israel and Bern, Switzerland, 17% in Japan, 22% in Cyprus, 23% in
Milan, Italy, 31% in Dubai, 35% in Chișinău, Moldova and Uzbekistan, 36% in
Kyrgyzstan and 38% in Rome, Italy.[120] In total, exit polls organized by
exiled Russian activists across 44 countries showed Davankov gaining more
votes than Putin in all but five countries.[124]

The election was also held in Moldova's Transnistria, an internationally
unrecognized state. 46,179 people with Russian citizenship voted in the
election, the lowest turnout in a Russian presidential election in the last 18
years. 97% voted for Putin, with the other three candidates not having even
obtained 1,000 votes combined.[125] According to TRT Russian, the low turnout
indicated changes in the political activity of Transnistrians with Russian
citizenship, with over 73,000 having participated in the last election six
years ago. Furthermore, it stated Moldovan analysts believed the low turnout
indicated a trend that Transnistria was moving away from Russia and that
Moldovan President Maia Sandu's pro-European policy was influencing the
region.[126]

## Election observers

The domestic watchdog Golos, having been previously labelled a "foreign agent"
in 2013 after documenting fraud in the 2011 parliamentary vote and the 2012
presidential election, was not allowed to send election observers. [127][128]

On 29 January 2024, the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human
Rights (ODIHR) announced that the organisation would not participate in
international monitoring of election, citing the lack of an invitation from
Russia.[129]

On 17 March 2024, the Chair of the Central Election Commission of the Russian
Federation (CEC), Ella Pamfilova, announced that 1,115 international observers
and experts from 129 countries were monitoring the electoral process.[130]

Russian presidential election candidates: Vladislav Davankov, Leonid Slutsky,
Vladimir Putin, Nikolai Kharitonov (left to right) on Red Square after the end
of the elections on 18 March 2024

On 6 August 2023, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told _The New York Times_
that "our presidential election is not really democracy, it is costly
bureaucracy. Mr. Putin will be re-elected next year with more than 90 percent
of the vote". Later he clarified that this was his personal opinion.[132] In
an interview with the RBK news agency, Peskov said that Russia "theoretically"
does not need to hold presidential elections because "it's obvious that Putin
will be reelected."[133]

On 6 November 2023, journalist Yekaterina Duntsova announced her intention to
run for the presidency in the 2024 election; she said she would run as an
independent candidate on an anti-war platform.[134] The next month, her
nomination documents were rejected by the Central Election Commission.[135]

In November 2023, nationalist ex-militia commander Igor Girkin announced his
intention to run as a candidate in the 2024 elections, describing elections in
Russia as a "sham" in which "the only winner [referring to Putin] is known in
advance".[136]

In January 2024, citing unidentified sources in the Kremlin, the independent
news outlet _Vyorstka_ reported that the CEC, at the behest of the Kremlin,
will likely reject Boris Nadezhdin's registration due to his criticism of
Putin and anti-war stances.[137] In late January 2024, a source in the Putin
administration told the Latvia-based news outlet _Meduza_ : "There's a portion
of the electorate that wants the war to end. If [Putin's opponent in the
elections] decides to cater to this demand, they may get a decent percentage.
And [the Putin administration] doesn't need that."[138] Russian state media
intensified a smear campaign against Nadezhdin in the weeks leading up to the
election. On 30 January 2024, Kremlin propagandist and television presenter
Vladimir Solovyov warned Nadezhdin: "I feel bad for Boris. The fool didn't
realize that he's not being set up to run for president but for a criminal
case on charges of betraying the Motherland."[138]

Following the CEC's decision to ban him from running, Nadezhdin wrote in his
Telegram channel: "I do not agree with the decision of the CEC...
Participating in the presidential election in 2024 is the most important
political decision in my life. I am not backing down from my intentions."[139]

Prior to the release of official results, former president and deputy head of
the Security Council of Russia Dmitry Medvedev congratulated Putin on his
"splendid victory".[140] After his victory was confirmed, Putin held a news
conference on 18 March calling his win a vindication of his policy of defying
the West and his decision to invade Ukraine.[4] He also described the result
as an indication of "trust" and "hope" in him.[98] Exiled Russian dissident
Leonid Volkov said that Putin's percentage of victory had "not the slightest
relation to reality".[141]

### International

In an interview with TV3 on 4 March 2024, Latvian justice minister Inese
Lībiņa-Egnere implied that Russians in the country who would participate in
the election to be held in the Russian embassy in Riga could face criminal
liability for justifying the invasion of Ukraine under Latvian law.[142] On 14
March, Lībiņa-Egnere appeared to have reversed her stance, stating that
participation in the elections "does not equate to supporting Putin" and is
"not punishable in any way"; she added that Latvia "does not want to provoke
an international row and intends to act like a democratic state".[143] On 11
March, Armands Ruks, the head of the Latvian State Police announced that
voters at the embassy would be subjected to police screenings before
entering.[144]

The Russian ambassador to Moldova, Oleg Vasnetsov [ru], was summoned to the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Moldova on 12 March following Russia's decision
to open six polling stations in Transnistria for the election, which Moldovan
foreign minister Mihai Popșoi described as "unacceptable". The Moldovan
government had previously agreed to open only one polling station in the
Russian embassy in Chișinău as per international law as it claimed.[145]
Russia's opening of polling stations in Transnistria was also condemned by
Romania, the United States[146] and France.[147] On 19 March, Popșoi announced
the expulsion of a Russian diplomat in response to the holding of elections in
Transnistria.[148]

The Ukrainian foreign ministry called on international media and public
figures "to refrain from referring to this farce as 'elections' in the
language of democratic states."[149] The United States condemned voting in
Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, with State Department Spokesperson Matthew
Miller saying that the US would "never recognize the legitimacy or outcome of
these sham elections held in sovereign Ukraine".[149] On 15 March, Ukraine's
ambassador to the United Nations, Sergiy Kyslytsya, released a joint statement
on behalf of Ukraine, the European Union and 56 other countries including the
US condemning the holding of the elections in occupied parts of the
country.[150] The Ukrainian government said it would not press charges against
its residents of occupied areas who participate in the election, saying that
they were being forced to vote.[151] The UN Security Council condemned the
holding of the elections in occupied territories of Ukraine with deputy
secretary-general Rosemary DiCarlo saying that "holding elections in another
UN member state's territory without its consent is in manifest disregard for
the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity" and were "invalid"
under international law.[152]

On the first day of regular voting on 15 March, European Council president
Charles Michel sarcastically congratulated Putin for winning a "landslide
victory" in the elections starting that day, adding that there was "No
opposition. No freedom. No choice."[112] On 18 March, the European Union
condemned "the illegal holding of so-called elections' in the territories of
Ukraine" and said it would never recognise them. The EU's foreign policy chief
Josep Borrell added that the election was held in the context of a shrinking
political space.[153]

Following the release of the results, Germany described the vote as a "pseudo-
election" under an authoritarian ruler reliant on censorship, repression and
violence.[154] The UK's Foreign Secretary, David Cameron condemned "the
illegal holding of elections on Ukrainian territory",[154] adding that the
vote was "not what free and fair elections look like". A spokesperson for the
United States National Security Council described the election as "obviously
not free nor fair given how Mr. Putin has imprisoned political opponents and
prevented others from running against him",[4] but said that the US would
recognize Putin as president.[155] In his evening address on 17 March,
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the election as an
"imitation" with "no legitimacy", adding that Putin was "addicted to power and
does everything he can to rule forever" and that "There is no evil he will not
commit to prolong his personal power."[156] Italian foreign minister Antonio
Tajani described the election as "neither free nor fair", while Czech foreign
minister Jan Lipavský called the election a "farce and parody".[157]
Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis called the voting a
"procedure that is supposed to resemble elections", adding that "Some might
call it reappointment, lacking any legitimacy."[158] The French foreign
ministry said the "conditions for a free, pluralist and democratic election
were not met", but praised "the courage of the many Russian citizens who have
peacefully demonstrated their opposition to this attack on their fundamental
political rights."[159] South Korea refrained from commenting on the election
and said that "it would make considerations of 'appropriateness' in regard to
a possible congratulatory cable to Putin."[160]

Leaders of countries with neutral or friendly relations with Russia sent
congratulations to Putin on his victory,[f] along with President of Republika
Srpska Milorad Dodik, members of the Moldovan opposition, and Hamas political
chairman Ismail Haniyeh.[206][207] Presidents Aslan Bzhania and Alan Gagloev,
of the pro-Russian breakaway states of Abkhazia and South Ossetia
respectively, also congratulated Putin.[208][209]

### Protests

Russian_voters_line_up_at_embassy_in_Armenia_2.jpg)Russian immigrants outside
the Russian embassy in Yerevan, Armenia as part of the "Noon Against Putin"
event, 17 March 2024

On 1 February 2024, jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and his allies called
on supporters to protest Putin and the invasion of Ukraine on the last day of
the election on 17 March all going to vote against Putin at the same
time.[210] Following Navalny's death on 16 February, there were calls from
Andrius Kubilius, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya
for the EU to recognize the Russian elections as illegitimate.[211][212][213]
Navalnaya called for Russians critical of Putin to join the "Noon Against
Putin" initiative to form long queues at polling stations at noon on 17 March
before proceeding to vote for anyone other than Putin, spoil their ballots or
cast Navalny's name.[214] On the day of the action, Navalnaya joined queues
outside the Russian embassy in Berlin[215] for about six hours before casting
her vote for her husband and praising protesters for giving her "hope that
everything is not in vain".[154] In Russia, queues formed at polling stations
in Moscow and Saint Petersburg at noon.[216] Queues were also observed outside
Russian diplomatic missions worldwide, including in Belgrade, London,
Podgorica, Tallinn, Paris and Milan.[114][154][217][218]

In response to the protests, authorities in Moscow threatened to prosecute
participants under Article 141 of the Criminal Code of Russia, which
prescribes five years' imprisonment for the obstruction of elections or
citizens' electoral rights.[219] On 17 March, the Russian human rights group
OVD-Info said that 80 people in 20 cities across Russia were arrested for
election-related offences.[140] In response to the Noon Against Putin protests
abroad, foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova described the queues
outside Russian embassies as evidence of support for the Kremlin.[220]
