The **2024 Haryana Legislative Assembly elections** were held in Haryana on 5
October 2024 to elect all 90 members of the Haryana Legislative Assembly.

The schedule of the election was announced by the Election Commission of India
on 16 August 2024. The ballots were counted and the results were declared on 8
October 2024. A majority of the exit polls predicted a victory for the Indian
National Congress-led alliance. Contrary to predictions, the Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP) emerged as the single largest party in Haryana, winning 48 seats
and securing victory for the third consecutive time, becoming the first party
in the state's history to achieve this feat. Although the popular vote total
differed by less than one percentage point, the Congress managed to win only
37 seats.

The tenure of the 14th Haryana Assembly was slated to end on 3 November 2024.
In the previous Assembly elections held in October 2019, BJP the emerged as
the single largest party and formed a coalition government with Jannayak Janta
Party. Before the elections, Nayab Singh Saini of the BJP was the incumbent
Chief Minister.

## Background

The tenure of the 14th Haryana Assembly was slated to end on 3 November
2024.[1] The previous Assembly elections were held in October 2019, in which
the Bharatiya Janata Party emerged as the single largest party. After the
election, the BJP formed a coalition government with the Jannayak Janta Party
(JJP) with Manohar Lal Khattar becoming the Chief Minister and Dushyant
Chautala as his deputy.[2]

On 12 March 2024, Khattar resigned as the Chief Minister after the coalition
between the BJP and JJP came to an end.[3] Nayab Singh Saini of the BJP was
sworn in as the new Chief Minister on the same day with the support of
independents.[4] After three independents withdrew their support to the BJP
government in May 2024, Saini led a minority government.[5][6]

In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections held earlier in the year, the BJP which had
held all the seats following the 2019, retained five seats while the Indian
National Congress won the remaining five seats.[7]

## Major issues

### Farmers protest and demands

The three farm laws by the BJP-led central government in 2020 have been a
major point of contention with the farmers across various states. The farmers
in Haryana also participated in the protests with the demand for the repeal of
these laws, claiming that they adversely affect their crop sales and income
was a prominent issue of that time.[46][47] Another significant issue prior to
the elections was the demand for a Minimum Support Price (MSP) for farmers.
Farmer unions advocated the government to ensure that MSPs are legally
mandated, arguing that it will provide a safety net for their produce and
ensure fair prices. The demand arose from concerns that the farmers might face
financial instability due to fluctuating market prices without such
guarantees. The issue was part of broader discontent with the existent
agricultural policies and became a key topic in the electoral debates.[48]

### Agnipath scheme

The Agnipath Scheme was a tour of duty style scheme introduced by the central
government in June 2022, which proposed a four-year term recruitment into the
Indian Army, after which 25% of them would continue their service in the army
and rest would be dismissed. The scheme was seen as a move away from permanent
recruitment and became a contentious issue in Haryana with concerns that it
may lead to instability in employment for the soldiers.[49] The state
government introduced a quota for such relieved soldiers in certain state
government jobs.[50]

### Unemployment

Unemployment was raised as a significant issue in the state as indicated by a
survey by India Today.[51] Opposition parties questioned the effectiveness of
government policies in creating job opportunities for the youth, which made it
a central debating topic in the elections.[52][53]

### Inflation

Rising prices of essential goods and services was also raised as a major
election issue by the opposition parties.[53] They claimed that the inflation
has significantly impacted the cost of living in Haryana and questioned the
government's ability to manage inflation and provide relief to affected
citizens.[54]

### Wrestler protests

Haryana has a longstanding tradition in wrestling and sends the highest number
of wrestlers who represent India at major international events.[55] A group of
wrestlers have been protesting against the earlier chief of Wrestling
Federation of India BJP's Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who had sexual abuse
charges filed against him. The wrestlers accused Singh of failing to provide
them with safety and demanded justice against the same.[56] For the Khelo
India, which aims to promote sports at the grassroots level, the state was
allocated only 3% of the total budget, leading to dissatisfaction and
criticism from the sports community due to a perceived imbalance in the
distribution of resources and support for athletes in the state.[57]

## Campaigns

### Bharatiya Janata Party

The BJP focused its campaign on highlighting its record of merit-based job
creation and infrastructure development, and allegations of corruption during
the previous Congress rule. Narendra Modi addressed four rallies and called
the Congress the most "dishonest and deceitful" party.[58] The BJP had earlier
reshuffled its leadership and limited the campaigning of former chief minister
Khattar, who had faced opposition for his views.[59] Saini, who was not part
of the earlier government, became the chief minister few months before the
election. He had implemented several populist measures including merit-based
recruitment for new government jobs, distribution plots to families below the
poverty line, free bus travel to the poor, and regularisation of unauthorized
colonies. The party emphasised the schemes and also frequently highlighted his
background as an OBC leader.[60] Additionally, the BJP dropped a third of its
sitting legislators to counter the anti-incumbency sentiment and fielded more
than 20 new candidates.[61]

### Indian National Congress

In July, the Congress released a charge sheet criticising the BJP government
on issues like unemployment, unfilled government positions, increased crime,
and alleged mistreatment of farmers. On 15 July, it launched the _Haryana
Maange Hisab Abhiyan_ campaign, which was aimed at visiting all 90 Assembly
constituencies, exposing the government failures and gathering suggestions
from the public for its election manifesto.[62] Former chief minister
Bhupinder Singh Hooda and state Congress chief Udai Bhan announced a 'Rath
Yatra' after 20 August as a part of the campaign.[63]

## Manifestos

### Bharatiya Janata Party

The BJP's manifesto was titled _Non-Stop Haryana ka Sankalp Patra_ , which
outlined 20 key promises to address various issues across the state. The party
promised to provide ₹2,100 (US$25) monthly assistance to women under the
"Lakshmi Yojana" scheme and health insurance coverage of up to ₹1 million
(US$12,000) per family under the "Nirogi-Ayushman Yojana". The party also
promised a minimum support price for 24 crops. It further pledged to create
job opportunities for local youth in ten industrial cities, including a
special provision for 50,000 new jobs and guaranteed government jobs for 2
lakh youths without an exam. The manifesto also included guarantees of
affordable housing for 5 lakh individuals in urban and rural areas,
availability of gas cylinders for ₹500 (US$6.00) under the "Pradhan Mantri
Ujjwala Yojana", free tablets for students under the "Awasiya Balika Yojana",
and the construction of five Olympic class stadiums. Additionally, the party
promised new airports, high-speed rail corridors between major cities and
industrial expressways. It also aimed to raise social pensions based on
scientific formulas and provide loans up to ₹2.5 million (US$30,000) for the
other backward classes (OBC) for starting new business. Other promises include
increased medical and engineering opportunities for OBC students, interest-
free loans for agricultural education, and the creation of a sports university
and cultural center in the state.[64]

### Indian National Congress

The Congress's manifesto focused on women empowerment, support for the elderly
and disabled, job security for the youth, and improvement of the lives of
families, farmers, and OBCs. It promised ₹2,000 (US$24) per month assistance
for women and gas cylinders for ₹500 (US$6.00). It also guaranteed pensions of
₹6,000 (US$72) to the elderly, disabled, and widows, and that the restoration
of the old pension scheme for the government employees. For the youth, the
party promised 2 lakh government jobs and eradication of drugs from the state.
It also promised 300 units of free electricity, medical coverage up to ₹2.5
million (US$30,000), a 100-yard plot and a two-room house costing ₹0.35
million (US$4,200) for the poor. The farmers were promised a legal guarantee
of MSP and quick compensation for crop losses. The OBCs were promised a caste
based survey and an increase in the creamy layer limit to ₹1 million
(US$12,000).[65]

## Surveys and polls

The exit polls were released on 5 October 2024 after the polling ended. Most
of the exit polls predicted a victory for the Congress.[66] However, in actual
result the BJP formed the government.

## Reactions

While the BJP celebrated their victory and hailed the elections as historic,
the Congress rejected the Haryana election results, citing irregularities in
certain districts and raising concerns about the functioning of EVMs. During a
press conference, Congress leader Pawan Khera declared that the party could
not accept the outcome.[79][80] Congress leader Jairam Ramesh mentioned a
"conspiracy," suggesting that in constituencies with higher battery levels
(99%), the BJP won, while in those with lower levels, the Congress won.
However, the party has not provided clarity on how battery levels are linked
to tampering, and senior Congress leaders Bhupinder Hooda and Kumari Selja
have already conceded defeat.[81][82]

The Election Commission of India (ECI) has denied the allegations and has
stated that no complaints regarding EVM batteries were raised by candidates or
polling agents during the process. The ECI also dismissed earlier complaints
from the Congress about a slowdown in result updates as ill-founded.[83]

Over the years political parties, including the Congress, Samajwadi Party, and
Bahujan Samaj Party, have raised concerns about EVM manipulation. However, the
Supreme Court and the ECI have consistently maintained that EVMs cannot be
manipulated. In April 2024, the Supreme Court rejected a plea for returning to
paper ballots or 100% VVPAT slip counting.[82][84] Interestingly, these
allegations were raised by the members of the I.N.D.I.A bloc alliance when
facing electoral defeat.[85]
