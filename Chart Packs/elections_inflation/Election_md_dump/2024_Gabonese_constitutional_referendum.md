A constitutional referendum is scheduled to be held in Gabon on 16 November
2024.[1] The vote is on a new constitution;[2] it proposes, among other
things, a 7-year presidential term, renewable once.[3] The referendum may lead
to the return to a civilian regime which the military junta promised after the
coup d'état in 2023.[4]

## Background

[edit]

After 56 years of leadership under Omar Bongo and his son, Ali Bongo, the 2023
coup brought about military rule.[5] In September 2024 a draft of the proposed
new constitution was handed to transitional president Brice Oligui Nguema.[6]
Gabon’s parliamentarians submitted their proposed amendments ahead of a 22
September deadline.[7]

The minister for institutional reform in Gabon, Murielle Minkoue Mintsa,
announced the date which the vote will take place – 16 November 2024.[8]

## Constitution

[edit]

The new constitution includes abolishing the office of prime minister with
seven-year term for the President of Gabon limited to two terms.[9] The role
of the prime minister would be replaced by a vice president.[10] The official
language of Gabon will continue to be French.[11] Mandatory military service
may be considered.[11] The new constitution would also outlaw same-sex
relations and to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman.[12]

The insistence that "only people born to a Gabonese father and mother can run
in the presidential election" is controversial among those of mixed
heritage.[13] This section is considered to prevent former first lady Sylvia
Bongo Ondimba and her son Noureddin Bongo Valentin, both of whom have dual
French-Gabonese nationality, from standing.[14]

## Conduct

[edit]

The provisional government is authorizing international observers to observe
the referendum, something that was not permitted for the 2023 Gabonese general
election.[15]
