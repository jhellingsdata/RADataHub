Parliamentary elections were held on Uzbekistan on 27 October 2024 to elect
members of the Legislative Chamber.[1][2]

## Electoral system

[edit]

The 150 members of the Legislative Chamber are elected via parallel voting:
half are elected in single-member constituencies via first-past-the-post
voting, while the other half are elected via closed list proportional
representation in a single nationwide constituency with an electoral threshold
of 7% using the Hare quota. If less than one-third of eligible voters
participate in an election, it will be considered invalid, and if no party
crosses the electoral threshold for proportional seats, the elections for the
proportional seats will be considered invalid. At least 40% of candidates must
be women.[3]

## Preliminary results

[edit]

Turnout surpassed the 33% threshold needed for the election to be valid. All
candidates came from the country's five registered political parties, none of
which are in opposition to the government of President Shavkat Mirziyoyev.[4]

Results of the election showed 64 deputies for the Movement of Entrepreneurs
and Businessmen – Uzbekistan Liberal Democratic Party, 29 from the Democratic
Party of Uzbekistan, 20 from the People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan, 21
from the Social Democratic Party, and 16 from the Ecological Party of
Uzbekistan.[5][6]

## Aftermath

[edit]

The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe criticized the
election for the lack of "a genuine choice" for voters, since all
parliamentary parties are loyal to the President and opposition is suppressed.
However, the organization also praised the reforms to the voting system that
reserved more seats for women.[7]
