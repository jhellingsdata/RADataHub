The **2024 British Columbia general election** was held on October 19, 2024,
to elect 93 members (MLAs) of the Legislative Assembly to serve in the 43rd
parliament of the Canadian province of British Columbia.

The election was the first to be held since a significant redistribution of
electoral boundaries was finalised in 2023. The Legislative Assembly also
expanded in size from 87 seats to 93 seats. The election saw a broad political
realignment in British Columbia;[2] amid a resurgence in the Conservative
Party of British Columbia, the BC Liberals (which had rebranded as BC United)
seeing no realistic prospect of victory, withdrew its candidates a little over
a month before the election to avoid splitting the vote. The party formally
endorsed the Conservatives, with several BC United candidates either defecting
to the Conservatives or standing as independent or unaligned candidates; this
marked the party's first absence from a provincial election since 1900.

The preliminary vote count was completed on October 20 with a record 2,037,897
votes cast in total. A final count triggered automatic recounts in close
races, as well the inclusion of approximately 65,000 out-of-district and mail-
in ballots.[3][4][5] For the first time, the BC NDP formed government three
times in a row, and its second consecutive win in the majority, but with a net
loss of eight seats. The Conservatives formed the official opposition, with
their best electoral performance in 72 years.[6][7]

## Redistribution of electoral districts

[edit]

Main article: 2021 British Columbia electoral redistribution

The Electoral Boundaries Commission was required to complete a redistribution
of seats following the 2020 general election, and the government subsequently
appointed commissioners in October 2021. Their final report was completed
April 3, 2023.[8] An act was passed later that year, providing for a
consequential increase in seats from 87 to 93, upon the next election.[9] The
following changes were made:

## Background

[edit]

Section 23 of British Columbia's _Constitution Act_ provides that general
elections occur on the third Saturday in October of the fourth calendar year
after the last election.[10][11] The same section, though, makes the fixed
election date subject to the lieutenant governor's prerogative to dissolve the
Legislative Assembly as they see fit (in practice, on the advice of the
province's premier or following a vote of non-confidence).[10][12]

BC United MLA Karin Kirkpatrick originally announced on February 8, 2024, that
she would not seek re-election.[44] However, after the campaign suspension of
BC United, she changed her mind and decided to run as an independent
candidate.[45]

### Withdrawal of BC United

[edit]

On August 28, 2024, BC United leader and Leader of the Opposition Kevin Falcon
announced that the party would pull out of the campaign. Falcon endorsed the
BC Conservatives, saying "John Rustad and I haven't always agreed on
everything, but one thing is clear: our province cannot take another four
years of the NDP". Falcon noted that this was done to prevent vote splitting
in competitive ridings.[46]

Mike Bernier (Peace River South) pointed out that Falcon, as leader, only had
the power to withdraw the party from the forthcoming contest, but could not do
so on behalf of the individual candidates.[47] Elections BC confirmed that
that was a correct interpretation of the elections law, and only the
candidates could choose to withdraw or to stand as independent or unaffiliated
on the ballot.[47] Several BCU candidates were openly considering accepting a
Conservative nomination.[48] Bernier confirmed that he had spoken with Karin
Kirkpatrick (West Vancouver-Capilano) about the possibility of several of the
BCU candidates forming their own alliance or possible new party before the
required registration deadline,[47] or even forming a party post-election, as
Legislature rules recognize a party as long as it has at least two MLAs.[47]

On September 20, BCU announced that it would not field any placeholder
candidates in this campaign. Under BC's election law, they can still maintain
their registration as long as they nominate candidates in the next round
(tentatively scheduled for 2028).[49]

There was further fallout in September, when a mailout was sent to BCU's
members urging them to renew their membership, under a letterhead bearing the
name of John Yap (who had resigned as party president the previous month).[50]
It was speculated that the mailing had been previously scheduled but not
cancelled upon BCU's staff vacating their offices.[50] BCU also secured a
commitment from the Legislature to cover any shortfall in meeting severance
obligations for their staff, estimated to cost up to $1 million.[50]

Herb Dhaliwal, a former federal Cabinet minister, attempted to found an
organization to be called the New Liberal Party of BC, but found that BCU
still controlled the Liberal name under BC's election law.[50] He urged
Elections BC to reconsider its decision, saying, "There are lots of people,
they're not interested in voting for either [the BCU or the Conservatives], so
they feel betrayed and they feel orphaned by what's happened."[51]

Prior to folding, the party had commissioned research to aid in attacks on
Conservative nominees. Former MLA and current media personality Jas Johal
released a file that was subsequently confirmed to be a working draft,
although incomplete.[52] The NDP were making use of the released
information.[53]

At the time of BC United's withdrawal, the party had nominated candidates in
56 ridings.[54][e]

### Independent wave

[edit]

40 independent and 14 unaffiliated candidates, a record number, were in the
race by the time nominations closed.[65][66] 18 of those candidates were
previously BC United candidates or MLAs. This is notable, as only one
Independent has been elected to the Legislature in the past 60 years—Vicki
Huntington (Delta South) in 2009 and 2013. At the beginning of the campaign,
six incumbent MLAs announced that they intended to run as such, of which five
had been with BCU and one with the NDP.[67] Karin Kirkpatrick expressed the
view that the Conservatives had brought this phenomenon on themselves in
believing that BCU members would follow Falcon's lead in switching over.
"That’s not how democracy works. People want to run. They’re going to run, and
so they’re floundering right now."[67]

### Indigenous candidates

[edit]

Eleven candidates of Indigenous background are standing for election—two
Conservatives, seven NDP and two Greens.[68]

### Vote counting

[edit]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/BC_Polling_place_2024.jpeg/220px-
BC_Polling_place_2024.jpeg) A polling place for the general election in
Surrey.

After trials during by-elections in 2022, Elections BC adopted digital voter
rolls and electronic tabulation machines for the first time during this
election. The digital roll made it possible to cast ballots at any polling
location across the province and enabled mail-in ballots returned before the
last day of advance voting – October 16 – to be counted instantly (they were
previously counted two weeks after Election Day, thus casting in doubt certain
close results).[69][4]

The tabulators facilitated the vote count process and it was projected that
98% of votes would be reported one hour after polls close, not accounting for
mail-in ballots returned after the last day of advance voting, and close
results subject to manual recount.[70]

An atmospheric river event struck southwestern British Columbia from October
18 to October 20; rainfall was heaviest in the Lower Mainland on October 19,
causing flooding in North Shore communities and Surrey, and several street and
highway closures.[71][72] Elections BC stated that paper ballots would be
available at voting sites in the event of power outages, and that it had made
BC Hydro aware of the locations of voting sites so that they can be
prioritized in the event of an outage. While it was suggested that the weather
could impact voter turnout, Elections BC stated that a record number of
advance ballots had been cast for the election, while the last day of advance
voting on October 16 had set a single-day record of 223,000 ballots cast.[73]

## Campaign

[edit]

### New Democratic

[edit]

On September 20, one day before the writ was dropped, the BC New Democratic
Party unveiled their campaign bus in Surrey, which is home to some anticipated
key ridings, marking the start of their campaign.[106]

On September 23, the BC NDP released a video of Rustad saying he regrets
receiving the "so-called [COVID-19] vaccine", as well as claiming the vaccine
mandates were about population control.[107] BC NDP leader David Eby
criticized these statements, asserting that such beliefs are based on internet
conspiracies and that Rustad could not be trusted on health policy.[107]

On September 25, Eby promised his party would provide 25,000 new homes while
financing 40% of the purchase price for first-time home buyers, at an annual
cost of $1.29 billion.[108] On September 27, he stated that the government
would continue its focus on the use of prefabricated homes as a strategy to
ease the housing crisis, with the government pre-approving designs for permits
and developing skills training programs in consultation with the
industry.[109]

Following the Conservative Party's tax rebate proposal, the New Democrats
announced their tax relief plan on September 29. Eby announced that $10,000 of
individual income will be exempted from annual tax, adding that 90% of
taxpayers would save $1,000 per year.[110][111]

On October 1, Bowinn Ma, NDP candidate in North Vancouver-Lonsdale, announced
the party would connect West Vancouver and Metrotown, Burnaby with a Bus Rapid
Transit line, which will be entirely separated from traffic. In short term,
they would also guarantee the existing R2 RapidBus would be extended from
Phibbs Exchange to Metrotown.[112]

On October 4, the NDP filed a petition with the Supreme Court of British
Columbia seeking to compel Elections BC to change the name of the Conservative
Party on ballot papers from "Conservative Party" to "B.C. Conservative Party",
on the grounds that Rustad was "pretending to be part of the federal
Conservative Party". A court ruling in favour of the NDP would require all
ballot papers to be reprinted.[113]

### Conservative

[edit]

On September 21, John Rustad chose to kick off the campaign in CRAB Park, a
homeless encampment near Vancouver's Downtown Eastside.[114] In his speech, he
emphasized the severity of the addiction issue, as well as the importance of
removing the carbon tax and investing in healthcare.[114]

On September 22, Rustad announced that he would close all safe injection sites
in the province, and replace them with mental health and addictions treatment
centres.[115][116] He referred to the sites as "drug dens", and pledged to end
the decriminalization and safe supply policy introduced by the NDP
government.[115] In response, NDP leader David Eby and Green leader Sonia
Furstenau both condemned the platform, pointing out the closure of safe
injection sites would push the drug addicts back on streets.[116] The
following day, Elenore Sturko clarified that the party did not plan to
immediately close all of the safe injection sites at once as implicated by
Rustad, but transition them to treatment centres gradually. Sturko stated that
"this is about transitioning people, not medicating them", and that "we need
to make sure the model is supported medically".[117]

On September 23, Rustad revealed the Conservatives' plan for tax rebates to
alleviate high housing costs, which he claimed would be the greatest tax cut
in BC history.[118] The rebate would allow renters and homeowners with
mortgage to exempt up to $3,000 per month from their provincial income tax.
The program would start in 2026, where the exemption would begin with $1,500
per month, costing $900 million for the first year. The exemption amount would
increase by $500 each year, and the final annual cost would be at $3.5
billion.[119][120]

On September 25, Sturko requested an investigation by the Registrar of
Lobbyists for BC against Ravi Kahlon, the incumbent Minister of Housing. She
alleged the minister might be involved in a conflict of interest as his sister
Parm Kahlon owns a government relations firm, where a client of the firm would
be a potential partner in housing projects.[121] Kahlon has refuted the
allegation and defended that the housing company does not do work with the
government.[121]

On September 27, Rustad announced the housing platform for the Conservative
Party. He committed to set deadlines for municipalities to issue rezoning,
development and building permits. He also intended to repeal the BC's Step
Code policy and Net-Zero mandate, which he claimed to have driven the
construction cost up by 30–40%. On top of the NDP's transit-oriented policy,
Rustad further assured they will amend the bill to require grocery stores and
small businesses to be within walking distance of homes.[122]

On September 28, a few hours before the candidate nomination deadline, David
Eby issued an open letter requesting that Rustad to drop candidates which he
considered to have "dangerous and extremist views". Eby singled out five
candidates who had perpetuated conspiracy theories regarding the results of
the 2020 United States presidential election, Sheldon Clare for comparing gun
control to Japanese internment camps, and Bryan Breguet for his "bigoted and
sexist views". Rustad declined, and suggested in a reply that Eby investigate
Ravi Kahlon.[123] The party released its agricultural plan the same day,
including investments in agricultural development, financial support for
yield-increasing measures and expanding the Buy BC program. Rustad also
promised to review the Agricultural Land Commission.[124]

On October 14, the Conservative Party released their education plan, including
ending the SOGI 123 program (a program of materials related to gender identity
and sexual orientation, which Rustad considered to be indoctrination of
children), reintroducing letter grades for grades 4 to 9, and reinstating
provincial standardized tests for grades 10 and 12.[125][126]

During a speech to his supporters on election night, Rustad pledged to make it
"as difficult as possible" for the NDP if they formed a minority government,
in order to prevent "any more destruction in the province".[127]

### Green

[edit]

On October 8th, following the televised debate, American actor Mark Ruffalo
endorsed the Green Party.[128]

## Results

[edit]

British_Columbia_Election_2024_Results_Map.svg.png)Initial count result

On October 20 at 14:30, PDT, Elections BC completed the initial count. This
count included votes cast at district electoral offices, at advance voting and
on Final Voting Day. It also includes vote-by-mail ballots that were returned
by mail before the end of advance voting. The remaining votes were counted
during Final count, which concluded on October 28. As a result of the
remaining ballots counted, the Surrey-Guildford district flipped from
Conservative to NDP, resulting in a narrow NDP majority. Shortly after the
final count was concluded, Lieutenant Governor Janet Austin invited David Eby
to continue as Premier of British Columbia.

Judicial recounts are pending in two electoral districts:[342]

    

  * Kelowna Centre
  * Surrey-Guildford

A third recount was ordered in Prince George-Mackenzie, following the
discovery of an uncounted ballot box containing around 861 votes. Eleven
tabulator tapes were also found to have been missed, affecting the results in
six districts.[343]

It was anticipated that the above recounts and adjustments would have no
effect on the final results, insofar as in the 21st century only one recount
has resulted in the flipping of a seat, being that of West Vancouver-Sea to
Sky in 2020.[343]

The 2024 election was significant for several reasons:

    

  * This was the first time since 1975 that the Conservative Party won seats.[344]
  * It was also the first general election in British Columbia, as well as any other Canadian province or territory, to elect more women than men, with 49 of 93 (52%) female MLAs.[h][345]
  * The province has not experienced such a delay in determining the eventual winner since 1952.[346]
