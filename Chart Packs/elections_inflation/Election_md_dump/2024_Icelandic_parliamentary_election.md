**Parliamentary elections** are due to be held in Iceland on 30 November 2024
to elect the 63 members of the Althing.

## Background

[edit]

### Previous election

[edit]

Main article: 2021 Icelandic parliamentary election

The 2021 parliamentary election took place on 25 September, a month before the
latest date allowed by law. The government coalition of the Left-Green
Movement, the Progressive Party and the Independence Party, led by prime
minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir, had been in place since the 2017 elections. This
unusual coalition of parties from the left wing, the center and the right wing
of Icelandic mainstream politics maintained its majority in parliament in the
elections as the Independence Party had the same number of seats as before
while the Progressive Party added 5 seats and the Left-Green movement lost 3.
As for the opposition parties, the People's Party gained two seats and the
Reform Party gained 1 seat. The Pirate Party held steady but the Social
Democratic Alliance lost 1 seat and the Centre Party lost 4 of its seats in
parliament. The Icelandic Socialist Party received 4.1% of the vote but no
seats as 5% of the national vote is needed to eligible for the allocation of
leveling seats.

The coalition partners from the previous term soon decided that the first
option for coalition talks should be to renew their coalition. The second
cabinet of Katrín Jakobsdóttir was then formed on 28 November.[1][2]

### Fall of government

[edit]

In April 2024, Katrín Jakobsdóttir resigned to contest the 2024 Icelandic
presidential election, which she lost. She was succeeded as prime minister by
Bjarni Benediktsson.[3]

On 13 October, prime minister Bjarni Benediktsson announced that the
government had collapsed due to disputes over foreign policy, asylum seekers,
and energy, prompting him to call for new elections and ask President Halla
Tómasdóttir the next day to dissolve the Althingi and set the elections for 30
November.[3][4] In particular, Bjarni cited "how different the Movement's
vision for the future is, compared to what I want to stand for".[5]

## Electoral system

[edit]

Further information: Elections in Iceland

The 63 members of the Althing are elected by open list proportional
representation in six multi-member constituencies, with 54 seats distributed
between parties at the constituency level with no electoral threshold and 9
leveling seats assigned to party lists at the national level in order to
ensure proportionality with the election result, with a threshold of 5 percent
required.[6] The 54 constituency seats are distributed within each
constituency according to the D'Hondt method.[7] Election lists are determined
by parties; although voters have the option of altering the order of
candidates or striking out particular candidates entirely, this rarely has any
effect on the result.[6]

The number of voters per parliamentary seat varies significantly between the
constituencies of Iceland. The number of seats per constituency was determined
by law in 1999 and is not updated before each election except when the number
of voters per representative in the most represented constituency reaches half
the number of voters per representative in the least represented constituency.
The constitution stipulates that in this case, a constituency seat should be
transferred from the most represented constituency to the least represented
constituency. This has happened twice since 1999, in both cases transferring a
constituency seat from the Northwest constituency (a large rural constituency)
to the Southwest constituency (a relatively small constituency in area,
adjoining the capital city). In the 2021 election, the number of eligible
voters for each seat in the Southwest was 5671.5, more than double the 2693.5
eligible voters for each seat in the Northwest. According to the constitution
this means another transfer of a constituency seat from the Northwest to the
Southwest before the next parliamentary election.

### Date

[edit]

Per Article 23 in Chapter V of Act No. 112 from the 25 June 2021 Elections
Law, elections must be held no later than the same weekday of the month four
years after the previous elections, counting from the turn of the month;[8]
therefore, because the 2021 election took place on the fourth Saturday in
September, the latest possible date for the election was 27 September 2025.

Following the collapse of the government in October 2024, the election is set
to be held on 30 November.[9]
