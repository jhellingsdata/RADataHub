The **2024 Sardinian regional election** took place in Italy's Sardinia region
on 25 February 2024. The election was for all 60 elected seats of the Regional
Council of Sardinia, as well as the president of Sardinia, who automatically
became a member of the Regional Council. The election was won by Alessandra
Todde, who also became the first female president of Sardina. It was the first
election of the 2024 Italian regional elections.

A member of the Five Star Movement, Todde led the centre-left coalition to a
narrow win at 45.5% over the centre-right coalition and Brothers of Italy
candidate Paolo Truzzu at 45.0%, with Renato Soru finishing a distant third at
8.7%. It was the first time since the 2015 Campania regional election that the
centre-left coalition unseated a centre-right coalition regional president.
Although Truzzu was not the incumbent president, having taken the place of
Christian Solinas, the incumbent president since 2019 and member of the
Sardinian Action Party, which is nationally allied with the League and
affiliated to the centre-right coalition, it was still the centre-left
coalition's first regional gain since 2015. It was the first election since
the 2018 Lazio regional election where the winner of the presidential election
did not win the plurality in the party vote due to split-ticket voting.

## Background

[edit]

The election in Sardinia was called for 25 February 2024.[1] In November 2023,
the Democratic Party (PD) and the Five Star Movement (M5S) announced
Alessandra Todde, former undersecretary at the Ministry for Economic
Development during the second Conte government, as joint candidate for the
centre-left coalition.[2] Disappointment regarding the agreement between PD
and M5S emerged among potential coalition partners, such Italia Viva and More
Europe, who had always been sceptical about cooperation with M5S;[2] dissent
also came from within the party, with Renato Soru, former president of
Sardinia, criticising the decision to not hold an internal primary to choose
the candidate.[3] These disagreements led Soru to formalize his candidacy as
independent less than a week later, immediately obtaining the support of More
Europe and Christian Popular Union,[4] and later joined also by Action,[5] the
Communist Refoundation Party,[6] a list of PD dissidents,[7] and a coalition
of independentist movements.[8]

The centre-right coalition faced internal divisions, with the incumbent
president Christian Solinas seeking re-election with the support of the
Sardinian Action Party (PSd'Az) and the League (Lega) but without the support
of Brothers of Italy (FdI), whose regional coordinator had urging for a change
of direction.[9] During a meeting on 4 January 2024, a majority of the
coalition members opted for Paolo Truzzu (FdI), the incumbent mayor of
Cagliari, as candidate for the presidency, resulting in Solinas and the
parties supporting his bid considering to break away from the coalition.[10]

Coalition talks to reach a deal over a unitary candidacy went on
unsuccessfully for a couple of weeks; the sudden news of Solinas being under
investigation for corruption decreased significantly his chances of being a
feasible candidate.[11] The corruption charges, together with the other
coalition partner's will to compromise with the League on other regional
candidacies and on the introduction of a third mandate for regional governors,
ultimately led the party to announcing its support to Truzzu's candidacy on 19
January 2014.[12] Shortly after Lega's announcement, Solinas officially
withdrew himself from the race, with PSd'Az choosing to endorse Truzzu.[13]

The fourth candidate to join the race was Lucia Chessa, leader of the
regionalist party Red Moors.[14] Interest in running for the presidency was
also expressed by Maria Rosaria Randaccio, with the support of the two
Eurosceptic and anti-establishment movements Force of the People and Sardinia
Free Zone;[15] her bid was rejected by the electoral authority due to failing
to gather the necessary signatures to take part in the election.[16]

## Election system

[edit]

The candidate who obtains a plurality of the votes is elected president of
Sardinia. If the elected candidate obtains at least 25% of the votes, the
majority of the seats on the board are guaranteed on the lists who support
them.[17] The Sardinian electoral law provides for a single round, with a list
vote, the possibility of expressing a preference within the chosen list, and
voting for the presidential candidate, on a single card. It is possible to
vote for a list and for a candidate who is not connected to each other
(Article 9). The candidate who has obtained the relative majority is elected
president (Article 1, paragraph 4). To the lists connected to the president-
elect, a majority prize may be awarded in the following measure: 60% of the
seats if the president-elect obtained a percentage of preference above 40%;
55% of the seats if the elected president has obtained a percentage of
preferences between 25% and 40%, while no majority prize is awarded if the
president is elected with less than 25% (Article 13). The law provides for a
10% threshold for coalitions, and 5% for non-coalitized lists (Article 1,
paragraph 7). No barriers are foreseen for the lists within the coalitions
that have exceeded 10%.[18]
