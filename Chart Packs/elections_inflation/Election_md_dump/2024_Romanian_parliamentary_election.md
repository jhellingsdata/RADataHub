Parliamentary elections are scheduled to be held in Romania on 1 December
2024.[1][2]

## Background

[edit]

### Cîțu Cabinet

[edit]

Further information: 2021 Romanian political crisis

Following the previous legislative elections held in December 2020, the Cîțu
Cabinet was appointed, backed by a centre-right coalition of three Romanian
political parliamentary parties: the conservative liberal National Liberal
Party (PNL), the progressive liberal/neoliberal USR PLUS (which subsequently
switched back to the old USR acronym in late 2021), and the Hungarian
minority-oriented Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania
(UDMR/RMDSZ).[3]

In September 2021, a major rift within the coalition led to the onset of the
2021 Romanian political crisis. Prime Minister Cîțu, with the backing of
President Klaus Iohannis, sacked Justice minister Stelian Ion.[4][5] All the
other USR ministers withdrew from the government by 7 September 2021,[6] which
left the Cîțu Cabinet in the minority. It subsequently fell in November 2021
in an unparalleled motion of no confidence (the highest number of votes
against a government in the political history of post-1989 Romania).

### National Coalition for Romania

[edit]

Further information: National Coalition for Romania

The political crisis ended with the formation of a grand coalition. As a
result, the Ciucă Cabinet, backed by the National Coalition for Romania (CNR)
comprising the PNL, PSD and the UDMR, was formed and remained in power until
June 2023, when the latter of the three parties withdrew from the majority. On
15 June 2023, as part of the rotation government deal, the National Liberals
made way for the Social Democratic-led Ciolacu Cabinet.

### 9th of June elections

[edit]

Further information: 2024 European Parliament election in Romania and 2024
Romanian local elections

Foreshadowing the elections in December, the 2024 European Parliament and
local elections took place on the 9th of June. The two governing parties
formed an electoral alliance in the European Parliament election, as well as
in some constituencies in the local elections. The results were seen as a
victory for the CNR,[7] although the PNL suffered many losses to their
coalition partners in races where they ran separately.[8] The newly formed
United Right Alliance registered significant losses, with the People's
Movement Party losing 88% of its mayors and the Save Romania Union losing key
races in Brașov, as well as Bucharest, particularly Sectors 1 and 2, where the
mayoral candidates who lost their seats claimed that electoral fraud took
place.[9] The USR's poor performance led to the resignation of Cătălin Drulă
as party president and the ascension to the national stage of Câmpulung mayor
Elena Lasconi in his stead.[10]

## Timeline

[edit]

### Date of the election

[edit]

Both parliamentary and presidential terms are scheduled to end in late 2024.
After consulting the various parliamentary groups, the Ciolacu Government
announced the parliamentary elections would take place on the 1st of December,
with the presidential elections taking place around the same time (first round
on 24 November, second round on 8 December),[11] making 2024 the first time
for such an electoral concatenation in Romania since the 2004 general
election.[12]

The election date also coincides with Great Union Day, the Romanian national
holiday.

## Electoral system

_Palace_of_the_Parliament_%282024%29_%282%29.jpg)Palace of the Parliament

Both the 330 members of the Chamber of Deputies as well as the 136 members of
the Senate are elected in 43 multi-member constituencies based on Romania's 41
counties, the Municipality of Bucharest, as well as the Romanian diaspora
using party-list proportional representation. Law no. 208/2015 outlines that
each constituency is to be awarded one deputy every 73,000 people and one
senator every 168,000 people in accordance with the population data collected
on 1 January of the previous year by the National Institute of Statistics
(INS). Constituencies cannot have less than 4 deputies and 2 senators.[13]

Parties must pass a threshold of 5% of the national vote or at least 20% of
the vote in four constituencies. Electoral alliances must pass a higher
threshold, namely 8% for those with two member-parties, 9% for three and 10%
for alliances of more. Further seats (currently 18) can be added in the
Chamber of Deputies for ethnic minority groups that compete in the elections
and pass a lower threshold (5% of the votes needed to win a seat in the lower
chamber, calculated by dividing the number of votes of parties, alliances and
independent candidates that passed the threshold by the amount of seats that
they won).[14]

### New political parties

[edit]

In July 2021, the nationalist[15] Romanian Village Party (RoSAT), led by
Marian Vișu-Iliescu, was launched, claiming to represent the interests of
peasants, ignored by the major parties.[16]

On 19 September 2021, former PSD president Liviu Dragnea, along with former
ally Codrin Ștefănescu, launched the _Alliance for the Homeland_ (Romanian:
_Alianța pentru Patrie_ , _ApP_), a split-off from PSD and "an alternative" to
it according to both.[17]

On 3 October 2021, former PNL Prime Minister Ludovic Orban, who had just been
defeated for the leadership of the PNL by Florin Cîțu at the 2021 PNL party
congress, stated that he is willing "to create a new political construction
which would be ready to continue PNL's legacy".[18][19] In this regard, at
that time it was thought that he could be following Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu,
another former national liberal Prime Minister who subsequently left the PNL
in order to establish his own political party, more specifically the Liberal
Reformist Party (PLR), subsequently known as the Alliance of Liberals and
Democrats (ALDE) after its merger with the Conservative Party (PC), a now
defunct political party which was eventually absorbed by the PNL during late
March 2022.[20]

In addition, before further concrete steps on behalf of Orban, various
commentators stated that Orban's faction could part ways with the main PNL
should he not be designated PM after Cîțu's dismissal by the Parliament (which
also occurred in the meantime). Subsequently, after PNL started negotiations
with the PSD, more and more MPs resigned from the PNL and joined Orban's
faction in the Parliament. Orban's new party was officially registered in
December 2021 and is called "Force of the Right" (or FD for short).[21]

In November 2021, a new party called NOW (Romanian: _ACUM_) was formed. It has
a progressive and green ideology.[22]

Additionally, in November 2021 the S.O.S. Romania party was founded by Maricel
Viziteu, Adeluța and Gabriel Gib. However, it became later known on the
Romanian political scene in May 2022, after senator Diana Iovanovici Șoșoacă,
elected on the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) list, joined the
party, and eventually became its leader.[23]

Former PSD president and Prime Minister Viorica Dăncilă has, in the meantime,
become president of the Nation People Together (NOI) party.[24]

After the March 2022 congress of the Alliance for the Union of Romanians, Dan
Grăjdeanu, the president of the Orthodox Brotherhood NGO, announced that his
NGO will end the collaboration with AUR and launch its own political party. On
17 April 2022, a party affiliated with the Brotherhood was created: the
National Movement. It is led by Mihai Tîrnoveanu.[25][26][27]

Former independent/technocratic Prime Minister and PLUS/USR PLUS/USR member
(as well as former USR president) Dacian Cioloș officially quit the USR on 31
May 2022 to form a brand new party called REPER.[28] Several MEPs (more
specifically 4) who have been previously elected on the lists of the 2020 USR
PLUS Alliance at the 2019 European Parliament election in Romania have sided
with Dacian Cioloș for his newly established political project, but still
remain affiliated with the Renew group in the European Parliament. REPER can
thus be considered (and is, in actuality) a splinter of USR.

On 10 July 2022, ex-AUR deputy Mihai Lasca launched his own political party,
called Patriots of the Romanian People.[29] The party was labelled as
Eurosceptic, Romanian nationalist and anti-LGBT.[30]

The Green Party (PV) was also relaunched[31] under the new name of the **Green
Party (The Greens)** \- (Romanian: _Partidul Verde - Verzii_)). The party is
currently led by two co-presidents, more specifically Marius Lazăr and Lavinia
Cosma (former USR member between 2016 and 2019). The party first appeared in
the polls in the beginning of 2023.[32]

In late September 2023, PNL vice-president and deputy Ben Oni Ardelean
resigned from the party and announced that he is initiating a new political
project.[33] Consequently, he recently launched an allegedly conservative
political party called Hope's Movement (Romanian: _Mișcarea Speranței_) for
the disillusioned electorate in Romania.[34]

Civil society activists announced at the end of November the launch of the
Party for Nature, People and Animals (Romanian: _Partidul pentru Natură,
Oameni și Animale - NOA_). The party is temporarily led by Lucian Rad, former
county councilor in Brașov.[35]

On September 2, 2024, a group of 10 MP joined a new party called DREPT Party.
The party will be led by former independent MEP Vlad Gheorghe.

The progressive SENS Party [ro], was formed around independent ex-USR MEP Nicu
Ștefănuță, and achieved the necessary 100.000 signatures.[36]

The centrist Romania in Action Party, formed by the supporters of the
independent candidate for president Mircea Geoană, managed to collect over
160,000 signatures and will have candidates in all counties as well as in the
diaspora.[37]

### New political alliances

[edit]

In May 2022, the Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party (PNȚCD)
announced that it will prepare a new political alliance with the Alliance for
the Homeland (ApP, formerly known under the acronym PAINE)[38] for the
forthcoming Romanian parliamentary elections scheduled to take place in late
2024. The two parties will allegedly form a so-called "sovereignist" block
which will oppose the National Coalition for Romania (CNR).[39] In late August
2022 however, Liviu Dragnea, strongly associated in the past with the party at
an unofficial level, had decided to indefinitely distance himself from the
ApP.[40]

In June 2023, incumbent USR leader Cătălin Drulă stated that the Save Romania
Union (USR) wants to form a right-wing pole able to win the 2024
elections.[41] The alleged right-wing pole is envisaged to form around the USR
and become the winner of all the elections scheduled in 2024 in Romania,
according to the incumbent USR leader. In these regards, discussions have
already been carried out between USR and the People's Movement Party
(PMP).[42] The right-wing alliance proposed by the USR is presented as an
alternative to the current ruling CNR coalition formed by the Social
Democratic Party (PSD) and the National Liberal Party (PNL). The respective
right-wing or centre-right alliance/electoral block might also include the
Force of the Right (FD). It was later on reported in October 2023 by a USR
member that the Force of the Right (FD) will be included in the respective
alliance/electoral block at national level as well as the fact that he does
not exclude punctual future collaborations on several political measures with
the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR/RMDSZ).[43]

On 4 July 2023, the Socialist Romania Alliance (ARS), formed by the Romanian
Socialist Party (PSR) and the Social Democratic Workers' Party (PMSD) was
registered.[44]

On 23 September 2023, various extra-parliamentary far-right, ultra-nationalist
and traditionalist conservative groups announced the creation of the
Nationalist Bloc, led by Bogdan Mihai Alecu.[45][46][47][48]

On 14 November 2023, at an AUR press conference, Lidia Vadim Tudor (the
daughter of the late Corneliu Vadim Tudor), former Minister for Business
Environment Ilan Laufer (who is also the president of the National Identity
Force), businessman Muhammad Murad, entrepreneur Sorin Constantinescu and
Sorin Ilieșiu, as well as deputies Florică Calotă (who was elected on PNL
list), Daniel Forea (elected on PSD list), Dumitru Viorel Focșa (elected on
AUR, but later left) and senators Ovidiu Iosif Florean (elected on PNL list),
Călin Gheorghe Matieș (elected on PSD list) and Vasilică Potecă (elected on
PNL list) announced that they are joining AUR for the next election.[49]
Later, on 21 November, AUR announced, together with the Romanian Village
Party, National Rebirth Alliance, Romanian Republican Party and National
Peasants' Alliance the creation of a Sovereigntist Alliance to contest at the
2024 Romanian parliamentary election.[50][51]

On 25 November 2023, several extra-parliamentary political parties announced
the creation of the Romanian Sovereigntist Bloc, which includes: Right
Republican Party, Romanian Nationhood Party, Coalition for the Nation,
Reformist Party, Homeland Party, Christian Social Popular Union Party.[52][53]

On 9 December 2023, leaders of Green Party (Verzii) and Ecologist Party of
Romania (PER) announced a new political alliance on political scene for 2024
European Parliament elections, **AER for Romania Alliance** .[54]

On 14 December 2023, Save Romania Union, Force of the Right and the People's
Movement Party officially announced the creation of a right-wing electoral
alliance to contest in the 2024 elections.[55] On 18 December, the alliance
was formally named as United Right Alliance.[56]

On 14 March 2024, the Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party formed an
alliance with the Strong Romania Party.[57]

On 24 September 2024, Renewing Romania's European Project (REPER), the
Democracy and Solidarity Party (DEMOS), the NOW Party (ACUM), and independents
launched the Platform for Democracy, Prosperity, and Progress, a cross-
spectrum alliance of pro-European and progressive parties.[58] Volt Romania
(VOLT) also joined this alliance.
