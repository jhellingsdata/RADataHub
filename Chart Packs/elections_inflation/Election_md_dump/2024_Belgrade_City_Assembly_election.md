Local elections were held in Belgrade on 2 June 2024 amidst reports of
irregularities during the 2023 City Assembly election.[1][2] The election was
called after the constitutive session of the City Assembly of Belgrade failed
to meet quorum after the 2023 elections.

## Background

[edit]

### Protests

[edit]

Main article: 2023–2024 Serbian election protests

Shortly after the closing of the voting stations, SNS held a press conference
at which Vučić reported that SNS placed first in the election, winning 38
percent of the popular vote.[3] The election resulted in a hung parliament,
with Nestorović's MI–GIN being the party that could choose whether to side
with the ruling coalition of SNS and SPS or the opposition of SPN and NADA.[4]
Nestorović said that "even though no one gave us a chance, we became one of
the four or five strongest parties"; he rejected cooperating with either one
of the blocs after the elections.[5] "I think it will be very difficult to
form a city government. There will be new elections, probably soon. We will
not support either side", Nestorović also said.[4] Vučić also said that "If
Nestorović does not end up supporting anyone, you will have repeat
elections".[6] Nestorović and Aleksandar Pavić from MI–GIN rejected
cooperation with SPN after the elections and said that cooperation with SNS is
possible under certain demands.[7][8] MI–GIN later released a joint statement
in which they said that they will not support anyone and that they are ready
for new elections.[9]

Due to the election fraud, SPN announced that it would reject the results,
claiming that the election was not fair.[4] Aleksić claimed that over 40,000
ID cards were issued for voters who did not live in Belgrade in order for them
to gain the right to vote in the Belgrade City Assembly election.[4] SPN
called for the annulling of the results.[10] A day after the election, a mass
protest was organised outside the Republic Electoral Commission by SPN.[11] At
the protest, Aleksić and Marinika Tepić from SPN announced that they would go
on a hunger strike until the election results are annulled.[12] Aleksić and
Tepić were later joined by Jelena Milošević, Danijela Grujić, Janko
Veselinović, Željko Veselinović, Branko Miljuš, and Dušan Nikezić in the
hunger strike.[13][14][15]

At the 24 December protest, protesters tried to storm the building of the City
Assembly of Belgrade.[16] Vučić issued an urgent statement in response to the
attempt to storm the building of the City Assembly of Belgrade, saying that "a
revolution is not happening".[17] Amidst the protest, Ćuta was hit with a tear
gas.[18]

In the 2023 City Assembly election, the Serbian Progressive Party retained its
status as the largest party in the City Assembly by winning 49 seats. However,
the government formation process was postponed multiple times amidst
opposition protests and boycotts.[19]

### Government formation

[edit]

Like on national level for the parliamentary elections, opposition parties
pledged to form a government, if they were to win a parliamentary
majority.[20] Opposition parties and alliances that won representation after
the 2023 election and that expressed their support for the formation of a
government include SPN and NADA.[20][21] Pavle Grbović, the president of the
Movement of Free Citizens, said that "despite differences, some form of
cooperation is possible [with other opposition parties], especially at the
level of Belgrade".[22] Vojislav Mihailović, the president of the Movement for
the Restoration of the Kingdom of Serbia (POKS) and former mayor of Belgrade,
said that "in the local self-government of Belgrade, we do not decide over the
Franco-German agreement and other national issues" and that "he does not see
what can be disputed about the idea of unity of the entire opposition" after
the elections.[23] Miloš Jovanović, the president of the New Democratic Party
of Serbia (NDSS), said that "changes can only be made in cooperation with the
rest of the opposition".[23]

The constituent session of the City Assembly was held on 19 February.[24] Toma
Fila, who as the oldest councillor presided over the City Assembly, said that
there was no quorum and that the session would be postponed to 1 March.[24]
SNS, SPS and Mi-GIN deputies did not appear in the hall for holding sessions,
while opposition councillors entered and unfurled banners waiting for the
session to begin.[24] The constituent session of the Assembly of Belgrade was
postponed again to 3 March as councillors from SPS, SNS and Mi-GIN did not
show up again.[25] Šapić announced that SNS would negotiate with MI-GIN until
3 March.[26] Nestorović, however, re-confirmed MI-GIN's position of not
supporting the SNS-led government.[27] The quorum was not met again on 3
March, meaning that a new snap election has to be called by the president of
the National Assembly.[28]

## Date

[edit]

During a tour of the Military Technical Institute in Jakovo Vučić told
reporters: "If the President of the Serbian Parliament is elected on 11, 12 or
13 March, it doesn’t matter, the elections must be held by 11 or 12 May. So
they can be on 28 April, between the 45th and 60th day, according to the
law."[29] However, the fact that the president of the Serbian Parliament will
(most likely) be elected at the parliamentary session scheduled for 11 March
absolutely does not mean that new city elections must be called on that day,
or a day or two after that. Since the deadline for the constitution of the
Assembly of Belgrade expired on 3 March, the President of the National
Assembly must call for new elections for the city assembly within a month from
the day when the assembly was supposed to be constituted. Therefore, the
deadline for holding the Belgrade elections is 2 June.[30]

The opposition said that they will not participate in the elections if they
are scheduled for 28 April because it is impossible to implement the
recommendations of the OSCE and because a marathon is scheduled for that
day.[31] On 8 March ProGlas, Serbia Against Violence, NADA and Dveri signed an
agreement on free elections. In the Agreement, the public service is required
to provide timely and truthful information to the citizens about the course of
the election process, but also that all those who will participate in the
elections be equally represented on the public channels.[32]

On 10 March Vučić said that the elections in Belgrade will be held on 2 June
and that all other elections will be held in accordance with the legal and
constitutional deadlines.[33]
