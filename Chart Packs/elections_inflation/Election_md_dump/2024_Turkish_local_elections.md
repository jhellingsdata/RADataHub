Local elections in Turkey took place throughout the country's 81 provinces on
31 March 2024.[1] A total of 30 metropolitan and 1,363 district municipal
mayors, alongside 1,282 provincial and 21,001 municipal councilors were
elected, in addition to numerous local non-partisan positions such as
neighborhood representatives (muhtars) and elderly people's councils.

The elections took place ten months after the 2023 parliamentary and
presidential elections, where the Nation Alliance opposition coalition
suffered an unexpected narrow defeat to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's
governing People's Alliance. This was despite an ongoing economic crisis and
rapidly rising inflation. Following the defeat, the opposition six-party
coalition dissolved, with the main opposition parties Republican People's
Party (CHP) and Good Party (İYİ) fielding separate candidates for effectively
all mayoral positions. This was the first nationwide election to be contested
by the CHP's new leader Özgür Özel, who had successfully challenged his
predecessor Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu for the position in November 2023.

The Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party (DEM), which succeeded the Peoples'
Democratic Party (HDP) as Turkey's principal Kurdish minority rights party,
fielded its own candidates in many western metropoles, despite having
previously withdrawn candidates in favor of the Nation Alliance.

The results were described as a "spectacular upset" victory for the opposition
CHP,[2] which despite the lack of any electoral pacts managed to retain all
but one of its metropolitan mayoralties, while winning four more. In
particular, the party's candidates in Turkey's largest city Istanbul and
capital Ankara, Ekrem İmamoğlu and Mansur Yavaş, were re-elected by landslide
51% and 60%, respectively. Both mayors also won majorities in their respective
metropolitan councils, giving them significantly more powers than their
previous terms, and are now seen as potential presidential contenders for the
next Turkish presidential election.[_citation needed_] The CHP also won many
unexpected victories in areas that had been under government control for the
previous two decades, including Bursa, Balıkesir, Manisa, Kütahya, Adıyaman,
Amasya, Kırıkkale, Kilis and Denizli. The party also managed to win swathes of
districts within many provinces, many of which delivered vote swings of over
30% in the CHP's favor. Overall, the CHP won 35 of Turkey's 81 provincial
capitals, with the People's Alliance winning 32.[3]

This was the first nationwide election since 1977 where the CHP came first in
the popular vote, and the first election where the AK Party did not come first
since its foundation in 2001. Nevertheless, the AK Party retained a narrow
plurality in the number of district mayoralties won, and the People's Alliance
scored small but notable victories against the CHP in Hatay and Kırklareli.
The leader of the opposition Good Party (İYİ), Meral Akşener, announced her
pending resignation after her party almost halved its share of the popular
vote.[4]

## Background

[edit]

### 2019 elections

[edit]

During the local elections of 2019, the opposition parties had formed
alliances in key races, and had narrowly defeated the government in the two of
the biggest cities in Turkey, namely Istanbul and Ankara. The election in
Istanbul was won by a margin smaller than 0.2%, which the government
successfully petitioned for a re-run. Τhіѕ сulmіnаtеd іn thе mауοrаl еlесtіοn
οf Јunе 2019, whісh thе οррοѕіtіοn wοn іn а lаndѕlіdе.

### 2023 elections

[edit]

The elections took place nine months after the 2023 parliamentary and
presidential elections, where most parties opposed to President Recep Tayyip
Erdoğan rallied behind the leader of the Republican People's Party, Kemal
Kılıçdaroğlu, including the center-right Good Party (İYİ) and the pro-Kurdish
Green Left Party (YSP) (now renamed to Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party
(DEM)). Erdoğan, despite the predictions of most surveys, was narrowly
reelected. This was despite an ongoing economic crisis and rapidly rising
inflation. Following the defeat, the opposition six-party coalition was
dissolved by İYİ Party.[_citation needed_]

### Election of Özgür Özel as the leader of CHP

[edit]

Following the 2023 elections, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu remained as the leader of CHP
despite calls for him to resign.[5] This culminated in the contested 2023
party congress, where the deputy leader of the parliamentary group of the CHP,
Özgür Özel, was elected as the new leader of the CHP.[6] The call for change
was led by the mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem İmamoğlu, who heavily criticized the
way in which the CHP's election campaign was run.[6]

## Candidates and alliances

[edit]

### People's Alliance

[edit]

The governing AKP and their main partner MHP entered the election in a
partnership, where they endorsed each others' candidates in key
districts.[_citation needed_]

AKP nominated Murat Kurum, Member of Parliament for Istanbul (I) electoral
district and former Minister of Environment, Urbanisation and Climate Change,
for the mayoral election in Istanbul, which was endorsed by MHP. In Ankara,
the alliance nominated the mayor of the district of Keçiören, Turgut
Altınok.[7]

### CHP

[edit]

local elections

The main opposition CHP, which had won Ankara and Istanbul in 2019 nominated
the same mayors for a second term. Thus, Ekrem İmamoğlu was nominated for the
municipality of Istanbul, and Mansur Yavaş was nominated in Ankara.

### İYİ Party

[edit]

After the 2023 elections, İYİ leader Meral Akşener, along with the party's
executive committee, refused to cooperate with CHP like they did in 2019. This
was despite the CHP repeatedly offering an alliance with them.[8][9]

## Political parties participating in the election

[edit]

See also: List of political parties in Turkey

General information about the parties that meet the conditions to participate
in the election as of 2 January 2024 is listed here.[10][11] The Innovation
Party announced that it would not participate in the election.[12] The places
of 35 political parties on the ballot paper were announced by the YSK on 27
January 2024.[13]

Because of long-running court cases the Green Party and the Humanity and
Freedom Party were not included in the ballot.[14][15]: 38

## Security concerns and incidents

[edit]

Around 594,000 security personnel were deployed nationwide to ensure the
regular conduct of the election.[16]

On 10 February, gunmen opened fire at a campaign event in the Küçükçekmece
district municipality of Istanbul for AKP mayoral candidate Aziz Yeniay,
critically injuring one person. Seventeen people were arrested in connection
with the attack.[17]

On 10 March, 33 people suspected of involvement with Islamic State were
arrested in police raids in Sakarya Province on suspicion of plotting attacks
ahead of the election. Authorities also recovered weapons, cash and
"organizational documents".[18]

On election day, one person was killed and 11 others were injured following a
dispute over the election of a neighborhood administrator in Diyarbakır, while
six people were injured in clashes in Şanlıurfa Province.[16]

## Reactions

[edit]

President Erdoğan acknowledged the AKP's electoral losses but said that it
would mark "not an end for us but rather a turning point", adding that he
would respect the result, "correct our mistakes and redress our shortcomings".
The CHP’s Özgür Özel praised voters, saying that they had established a "new
political order" in Turkey leading to "a new political climate".[19][16] İYİ
leader Meral Akşener called for an extraordinary party congress amid demands
for her resignation.[20]

## Analysis

[edit]

This was the first election since the governing Justice and Development Party
(AKP)'s establishment in 2001 that it did not come first in a national
election, with the CHP winning 37.8% of the vote compared to the AKP's 35.5%.
It was the first nationwide election since 1977 in which the CHP came first.
CHP affiliated mayors now govern cities which make up 64% of Turkey's
population and 80% of its economy.[21] Commentators compared the vote to the
1989 local election, where the centre-left opposition at the time had scored
significant victories against long-standing right-wing governments and came
first in the popular vote. Nevertheless, the People's Alliance did score some
victories against the opposition, taking the traditionally opposition-leaning
mayoralties of Hatay and Kırklareli, and narrowly won a plurality of district
municipalities.[3]

The smaller centre-right opposition İYİ Party performed poorly across the
country, coming sixth in terms of popular vote and losing over half its vote
share. Its leader, Meral Akşener, called an extraordinary party congress but
did not announce whether she would run again for the leadership. Meanwhile,
the Islamist conservative New Welfare Party (YRP) came third with over 6% of
the vote, winning many municipalities in conservative areas from the AKP. The
pro-Kurdish DEM Party marginally improved their share of the vote, despite
some calls for boycotts in their traditional strongholds due to the likelihood
of mayors being forcibly removed from office by the Interior Ministry on
charges of supporting separatist terrorism. The Nationalist Movement Party
(MHP), the AKP's junior alliance partner, lost votes but retained control of
many key municipalities that it had won in the previous election.[3]

Described as an "electoral disaster" for President Erdoğan, commentators
speculated that any intention by the government to amend the constitution to
extend his presidential term would likely be put on hold.[2] Given the scale
of their victories, both İmamoğlu and Yavaş are widely seen as possible
opposition candidates for the next Turkish presidential election,[22] which
the government refused to bring forward in light of the results despite
speculation over early elections.[23]

## Canceled annulment

[edit]

On 2 April, authorities annulled the victory of DEM’s Abdullah Zeydan, who won
more than 55% of the vote in the mayoral election in Van and declared his
rival, Abdullah Arvas from the AKP, the winner despite garnering only 27% of
the vote.[24] The decision led to anti-government protests in Van and
Istanbul, as well as a rally in Ankara.[25] The CHP sent members to Van in
support.[26] Tuncer Bakırhan of the DEM called the reversal a "political
coup"[25] while the party referred to it as "unlawful and illegitimate".[27]
The following day, the Supreme Election Board heard Zeydan's appeal and
reinstated him as the winner.[28]
