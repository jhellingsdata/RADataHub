General elections were held in Indonesia on 14 February 2024 to elect the
president, vice president, and People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), which
consists of the House of Representatives (DPR), the Regional Representative
Council (DPD), and members of local legislative bodies (DPRD) at the
provincial and city/regency levels.[1][2] The newly elected members of the MPR
would be sworn in on 1 October 2024, while the elected president and vice
president would be sworn in on 20 October 2024.[3] Incumbent President Joko
Widodo was ineligible to run for a third term due to limitations established
by the Indonesian constitution.[4]

The election had over 204 million eligible voters voting in over 800,000
polling stations across the country on the same date. Three presidential
candidates contested the election: defense minister and retired army general
Prabowo Subianto, running with the mayor of Surakarta Gibran Rakabuming Raka,
former governor of Jakarta Anies Baswedan, running with House of
Representatives Deputy Speaker Muhaimin Iskandar, and former governor of
Central Java Ganjar Pranowo running with Political, Legal, and Security
Coordinating Minister Mahfud MD. The legislative election saw 24 contesting
parties – including six exclusively in Aceh – field over 250,000 candidates
contesting over 20,000 seats.

In the presidential elections, Prabowo received a majority of the vote in the
first round, requiring no runoffs. Prabowo's 96.2 million votes were the
highest received by any candidate in a democratic election in Indonesia,
surpassing Joko Widodo's 85.6 million votes won in the 2019 election. In the
legislative elections, eight parties qualified for the national legislature,
with the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) remaining the largest
party in the House of Representatives despite losing seats. Golkar gained the
most seats, while the United Development Party (PPP) lost national
parliamentary representation for the first time in its history as it fell
short of the 4% parliamentary threshold.

## Electoral system

[edit]

The election was held in accordance with the Law No. 7 of 2017. The General
Elections Commission (KPU), an independent statutory body was responsible for
organizing the election.

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/2024_Indonesian_Election_ballot_papers_in_Banten.jpg/220px-2024_Indonesian_Election_ballot_papers_in_Banten.jpg)Ballot
papers for the election in South Tangerang, Banten

All voters were given five ballot papers: one for president and vice
president, one for the House of Representatives (DPR), one for the Regional
Representative Council (DPD), one for the Provincial Regional House of
Representatives (DPRD Provinsi), and one for the City/Regency Regional House
of Representatives (DPRD Kota/Kabupaten) [id].[5] Voters in Jakarta received
just four ballot papers,[6] while overseas voters received just two.[7] Voters
used a nail to poke a hole in the ballot paper indicating which party or
candidate they wished to vote for, and then dipped their fingers in ink as a
precaution against voter fraud.[5]

### Presidential

[edit]

In order to run as a presidential candidate, a candidate had to be formally
endorsed by a political party or a coalition thereof holding a minimum of 20
percent of seats in the DPR or having won at least 25 percent of the popular
vote in the previous election, i.e. in the 2019 election.[8]

The voting procedure followed a two-round system, with voters simply choosing
one of the candidate pairs. A winning candidate required a majority and at
least 20% of the votes in over half of Indonesia's provinces to be declared
the winner. If no candidate pairs had fulfilled the criterion (50%+1 of total
popular votes), the election would have had to progress to a second round with
only the two candidates receiving the most popular votes, which would have
been held on 26 June.[5]

According to the Indonesian electoral law of 2017 and by the decision of the
Constitutional Court of Indonesia number 90/PUU-XII/2023, presidential
candidates have to:[9]

  * Be at least 40 years old or have/are currently holding positions that are elected through general elections, including regional head elections[10]
  * Have been resident in Indonesia for at least 5 years; and
  * Not have held foreign citizenship, either at the time of the election or at any time before.

### Legislative

[edit]

Members of both the House of Representatives (DPR) and the Regional House of
Representatives (DPRD) were elected from multi-member electoral districts
through voting with an open list system, and seat distribution is done with
the Sainte-Laguë method. There was a gender quota requiring at least 30% of
registered candidates to be female.[11]

A 4% parliamentary threshold is set for parties to be represented in the DPR,
though candidates could still win seats in the regional councils provided they
won sufficient votes. There were 580 DPR seats contested. Nationally, there
are 84 national electoral districts, with 301 provincial and 2,375 municipal
electoral districts. Senatorial candidates for the DPD were not allowed to be
members of any political party. Four senators were elected for each province –
a total of 152 members from all 38 provinces.[12]

These were the first elections for provincial deputies and representatives of
both Houses for Central Papua, Southwest Papua, South Papua, and Highland
Papua \- all new provinces formed in 2022. On 12 December 2022, Government
Regulation in Lieu of Law No. 1/2022 was signed and published to amend the
2017 electoral law to make the new electoral regions to those provinces and
facilitate the election there.[13]

Nusantara, the designated new national capital, was not a new separate
electoral region in the 2024 general elections as it is still under
construction and therefore had an insufficient population for it to have its
electoral district. Therefore, the government decided that the DPR will serve
as a temporary representation body until 2029 when Nusantara can be
established as a new electoral region. For the 2024 election, electors living
within Nusantara were included in the East Kalimantan electoral
region.[14][15][16]

## Voters

TPS_098_North_Jakarta%2C_2024_Indonesian_general_election_10.jpg)A polling
station in North Jakarta on election day

The voting age is 17, or less if the voter has an Indonesian biometric
identity card or e-KTP through marriage.[17][18] However, since the age of
marriage was amended to age 19 in 2019, there are no longer any married people
under the age of 17.[19] Members of the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI)
and the Indonesian Police (Polri) are not allowed to vote.[20] Around 33
percent of voters were Millennials, and 23 percent were part of Generation
Z.[21]

On 18 April 2023, the KPU announced that there were provisionally 205,853,818
registered voters, including 1,574,737 voters registered overseas. It was
planned that the vote would be held in 823,287 polling stations (TPS).[22]
This was updated to a "final" figure of 204,807,222 voters in July 2023, who
were to vote in 823,220 polling stations.[23]

Postal ballots were sent to Indonesian embassies overseas in early January
2024.[24] Although overseas voters cast their votes before voters in
Indonesia, the KPU explicitly banned any exit polls or publication of results
from overseas voting before the election process had been completed across
Indonesia.[25]

Voting occurred between 7:00 and 13:00 local time, although voters who had
arrived before 13:00 and were still in the queue were allowed to cast their
votes after the deadline.[26]

## Contesting parties

[edit]

See also: List of political parties in Indonesia

To participate in the election, political parties had to have branches in
every province in Indonesia, 75% of regencies or cities in those provinces,
and 50% of districts in regencies where the party have branches.[27] In April
2022, the Ministry of Law and Human Rights declared the names of 75 national
political parties eligible to register for the 2024 elections.[28][29] In the
end, a total of 24 political parties registered with the KPU to run in the
election nationally.[30] On 14 December 2022, the KPU announced that 17
parties would be eligible to contest the legislative election.

The Ummah Party, who the KPU deemed not qualified to participate in the
elections, accused the KPU of irregularities in the process. The party
subsequently filed a written complaint.[31] Following mediations brokered by
Bawaslu between the party and the KPU on 20 and 21 December, Bawaslu
instructed the electoral commission to repeat the verification process for
Ummah Party.[32] The party declared as qualified to participate in the
election on 30 December.[33][34]

Meanwhile, the Just and Prosperous People's Party (PRIMA), which registration
was initially rejected, filed a lawsuit against KPU, and won the right for a
second verification from the KPU.[35] However, on 19 April 2023, the KPU
deemed PRIMA not qualified to participate in 2024 elections after the party
failed in its factual verification phase, where the KPU found the party's
membership numbers below the required threshold.[36] The Indonesian Justice
and Unity Party and Berkarya Party also failed to qualify for the election,
despite participating in 2019 and having had party members elected as members
of regional legislatures then.[37][38]

## Presidential election

[edit]

Main article: 2024 Indonesian presidential election

### Candidates

[edit]

In July 2017, the House of Representatives passed a law that only parties or
coalitions with at least 20% of seats in the legislature (i.e. 115 seats), or
25% of votes in the previous election are eligible to submit a presidential
candidate. Requirements for presidential/vice-presidential candidates are,
Indonesian-born citizens, Indonesian citizens who were born abroad, a minimum
age of 40 and a requirement to "have a belief in the One and Only God". If the
candidates had spouses, they also had to be Indonesian citizens. A criminal
record resulting in over five years of incarceration or an active bankruptcy
bars a candidate from running.[40]

The Anies Baswedan–Muhaimin Iskandar and Ganjar Pranowo–Mahfud MD pairs
officially registered with the General Elections Commission on 19 October
2023.[41] The Prabowo Subianto–Gibran Rakabuming pair officially registered on
25 October 2023.[42]

#### Withdrawn support

[edit]

The National Awakening Party had previously declared support for Prabowo
Subianto but later rescinded their support and declared support for Anies
Baswedan with the National Awakening Party's Chairman, Muhaimin Iskandar,
being selected as Anies Baswedan's running mate.[43][44]

Demokrat had previously declared support for Anies Baswedan, but due to the
selection of Muhaimin Iskandar as Anies Baswedan's running mate, Demokrat
Party's Chairman Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono rescinded their support and then
declared support for Prabowo Subianto.[45][46]

The Indonesian Solidarity Party had previously declared their support for
Ganjar Pranowo but rescinded support and on 24 October 2023, officially
declared support for Prabowo Subianto[47][48]

#### Gibran's candidacy

[edit]

An October 2023 ruling by the Constitutional Court of Indonesia added an
exception to the 40-year minimum age criteria, allowing those younger than 40
who had been previously elected as regional leaders to run as presidential or
vice-presidential candidates. This allowed 36-year-old Gibran Rakabuming, son
of incumbent president Jokowi and mayor of Surakarta, to run for the vice-
presidency. The ruling was controversial as the court chief justice, Anwar
Usman, is Gibran's uncle.[49][50][51] Anwar Usman was ultimately demoted by
the _Majelis Kehormatan Mahkamah Konstitusi_ or the Honorary Council of the
Constitutional Court from the position of Chief Justice on 8 November after
finding him guilty of conflict of interest on the ruling.[52] Furthermore, the
KPU was found to have committed ethics violations surrounding Gibran's vice
presidential registration for allowing him to register his candidacy before
the commission had adjusted the age minimum for candidates in its internal
regulation.[53] A lawsuit was filed by the Indonesian Democracy Defenders
(TPDI) and the Indonesian Advocates Movement (Perekat Nusantara) against Joko
Widodo, Gibran Rakabuming, Anwar Usman and First Lady Iriana alleging nepotism
and political dynasty on the part of the respondents, but was dismissed by the
Jakarta State Administrative Court a day before the election.[54]

### Debates

[edit]

Five concurrent televised presidential and vice presidential debates were held
between 12 December 2023 and 4 February 2024. During the debate on 21 January,
Gibran Rakabuming was seen making a "ducking" gesture and pretending to search
for a lost item in response to an answer from Mahfud MD, which drew mostly
negative reactions online for its supposed rudeness.[55][56]

### Social media usage and disinformation

[edit]

_Parts of this article are copied directly from2024 Indonesian presidential
election_

Prabowo Subianto's campaign was noted for its efforts at rehabilitating his
image from his association with human rights violations during the
dictatorship of former President Suharto into a "gemoy" (cuddly) grandfather
figure among the youth, going as far as to make an animated avatar of him on
TikTok using artificial intelligence. Anies Baswedan's and Ganjar Pranowo's
campaign also used interactive AI chatbots to engage with voters.[57][58][59]

During the campaign, Anies Baswedan was targeted by a deepfake audio recording
purportedly showing him being chastised by a political backer in January.
Prabowo Subianto's campaign team used AI to depict children in a television
commercial in order to bypass laws prohibiting the appearance of minors in
electoral advertisements.[57]

Golkar, one of the parties supporting Prabowo for president, uploaded a viral
AI-generated deepfake video on social media of a simulation of Suharto, who
had died in 2008, in which he appeared to urge voters to select the party's
candidates in the upcoming election. This led some civil society organizations
to urge the KPU to implement regulations on the usage of artificial
intelligence.[60]

### Allegations of state support

[edit]

On 12 February 2024, investigative journalist Dandhy Laksono released a
documentary on YouTube directed by him, titled _Dirty Vote_ , alleging that
Joko Widodo used state funds to support Prabowo Subianto's campaign, becoming
viral within the day and prompting accusations of sabotage by Prabowo's
campaign team.[61] The presidential office denied the claims, while protests
were held in reaction to the allegations.[62]

### Candidates

[edit]

All legislative candidates has to be Indonesian citizens, over 21 years old,
senior high school (or equivalent) graduates, and have never been convicted
for a crime resulting in a sentence of five years or more. In addition, the
candidates for the DPR or local legislatures has to be endorsed by a political
party and are required to resign from their non-legislative government offices
– except for the president and vice president – or their state-owned company
positions. Legislators running for reelection or another body through a new
political party are also required to resign.[69] For each electoral district,
political parties are required to have at least 30 percent of running
candidates, rounded to the closest whole number, be women. This was changed
from the regulations in effect in the 2019 election, where the 30 percent
figure would be rounded up, and thus less women candidates overall would be
required.[70]

Candidate registration was opened between 1–14 May 2023, with a total of
10,341 candidates registering to run for the DPR. This included 17 of the 18
national parties registering a maximum of 580 candidates allowed each, with
only the Gelora Party registering less with 481 candidates.[71] A total of
9,917 candidates were recognized by the KPU as DPR candidates.[72]
Approximately 1,100 individuals registered as candidates for the Regional
Representative Council, with only 622 passing requirements.[73]

## Finance and logistics

[edit]

KPU_Workers_Unloading_Ballot_Boxes_Indonesia_2024.jpg)Workers unloading ballot
boxes in Jakarta the day before the election.

The Indonesian Government budgeted Rp 25 trillion (~USD 1.7 billion) for the
election preparations in 2022–2023, over half of which was used by the General
Elections Commission (KPU) and most of the remaining funds used by the General
Election Supervisory Agency.[111] The Ministry of Finance budgeted Rp 71.3
trillion for the whole election process, a 57 percent increase from the 2019
election's budget.[112] Around Rp 17 trillion (US$1.1 billion) of the budget
is earmarked for presidential election runoffs, if one is required.[113]

Over 1.2 billion ballot papers were printed, along with 4.16 million ballot
boxes.[114] According to KPU chairman Hasyim Asyari, the costs of printing the
legislative ballots alone was over Rp 800 billion.[115] Ballots began to be
printed in November 2023,[116] with the distribution of ballots mostly
beginning on 10 February 2024. Polling stations are intended to receive their
ballots the day before voting, although more isolated regions began
distribution earlier.[117] To reach more isolated polling stations,
helicopters, boats, and animal-drawn carts were employed.[118] KPU intends for
each polling station to serve a maximum of 300 voters, although regulations
allow for a maximum of 500. According to Hasyim Asyari, this was due to the
time constraints at each polling station.[119] Each polling station has four
voting booths.[120]

Over 5.7 million poll workers and volunteers (_Kelompok Penyelenggara Pemungut
Suara_ /KPPS) served at the polling stations in Indonesia and abroad. Due to
concerns over deaths of KPPS staff in the 2019 election, KPU added rules in
2024 limiting their age to between 17 and 55, in addition to providing proof
of good health.[121] Seven KPPS members are assigned to each polling station,
with one serving as the head.[122] KPPS staff are paid Rp 1.1 million to 1.2
million (~USD 70) for their work, double the payment received by KPPS staff in
2019.[123] Vote counting at each polling station occurs between 14 and 15
February, with vote recapitulation being done between 15 February and 20 March
at the village/subdistrict, district, and regency/city levels.[124] Each pair
of presidential candidates are also allowed a maximum of two witnesses for
each polling station.[125] The Indonesian National Police said that 4,992
personnel would be deployed to secure the counting of votes.[126]

As Indonesia's territory stretches across three time zones, voting began at
7:00 am in each time zone and closed at 01:00 pm., beginning at 22:00 GMT (13
February) in Papua and ending at 06:00 GMT (14 February) in Sumatra.[58]

### Incidents

[edit]

On 11 February, a mob in Paniai Regency, Central Papua, burned down a district
office along with a number of ballots and ballot boxes over a KPU decision to
relocate a polling station in the regency.[127] On 12 February, the KPU
ordered the postponement of voting in 108 polling stations in Demak Regency,
Central Java, due to flooding from the Wulan River.[128] On election day,
voting was delayed by several hours in 34 polling stations in Jakarta due to
flooding caused by a thunderstorm.[58] Voting was also postponed in some
polling stations in South Tangerang due to flooding.[129][130] In total,
37,466 polling stations across the country began voting considerably after
07:00 am.[131] In Western New Guinea, polls were not held in 1,297 polling
stations in Central Papua, Highland Papua and Papua Provinces due to problems
related to logistics and social tensions revolving around the local noken
system, in which a designated representative casts votes on behalf of a
group.[132]

Voting was not held in one polling station in Cimahi as the ballot box
delivered was found to be empty, while mixups of ballot papers were reported
in other polling stations in the city.[133] In Bogor Regency, Bawaslu
confirmed that eight ballot papers had been rigged to select certain
candidates before they could be distributed to voters.[134] Bawaslu also
confirmed that ballot tampering had occurred during overseas voting in
Malaysia.[135] Migrant organizations in Malaysia also reported that ballots
were being bought for between 25 and 50 ringgit (between US$5–10).[136]
Bawaslu recorded around 1,200 electoral violations during the vote, mostly
from ethical infractions and neutrality violations by government
employees.[137]

Since 14 February, at least 57 election officers across the country have died
from fatigue and work-related accidents and diseases during the counting of
ballots.[138] Intimidation against election officers was reported in 1,473
polling stations, while 6,084 polling stations received mixed up ballots.[131]

During the vote-counting, allegations emerged of votes appearing larger on the
KPU-generated online application Sirekap (Recapitulation Information System)
than what the actual results showed. Bawaslu attributed the issue to possible

## Aftermath

[edit]

Following the results of unofficial quick counts, Prabowo claimed victory on
the evening of 14 February at an event with his supporters at Istora Senayan
in Jakarta, calling it "the victory of all Indonesians."[184][185] Gibran
Rakabuming also expressed thanks to Prabowo for "giving young people a
chance."[62] Ganjar Pranowo's campaign team said that they were investigating
reports of electoral violations and alleged "structural, systematic and
massive fraud" during the voting.[186] Hasto Kristiyanto, the secretary-
general of the PDI-P, said that election irregularities were enforced from the
top down, beginning with the decision to allow Gibran Rakabuming Raka to run
for vice-president. Hamdan Zoelva, former chief justice of the Constitutional
Court and a member of Anies Baswedan's campaign team also said that there were
"strong indications that violations occurred in a structured, systematic and
massive way in the presidential election".[187] Remarks by independent
observers indicated there were "no signs of systemic fraud".[188] Prabowo
again expressed thanks to the electorate after the official confirmation of
the election results on 20 March.[189]

The Indonesia Stock Exchange on 15 February recorded its sharpest rise in two
months as quick count results indicated Prabowo's victory, which analysts
attributed to the removal of political uncertainty which would arise from a
runoff election. Largest gains were made by banks, nickel companies, and
infrastructure firms.[190]

In total, the Constitutional Court received 297 lawsuits related to the
results of the legislative election.[191]

###  Protests

[edit]

Following the allegations, police said that it would allow peaceful
protests.[192] A demonstration was held in front of the Istana Merdeka in
Jakarta in protest against Prabowo's claims of victory on 15 February,
followed by rallies on 16 February against alleged electoral fraud[193] and
Joko Widodo's perceived support for Prabowo at the KPU headquarters.[187] Joko
Widodo dismissed the allegations of fraud, saying that evidence for fraud
should be brought to Bawaslu and the Constitutional Court.[194] On the day the
official election results were finally released on 20 March, 300 demonstrators
protested alleged electoral fraud and Joko Widodo's support for Prabowo
outside the KPU headquarters.[195]

On 22 April, the Constitutional Court rejected all legal challenges against
the results of the presidential election, allowing the KPU to declare the
Prabowo-Gibran tandem the winner.[196][197][198]

###  Analysis

[edit]

After the release of quick count results, Lingkaran Survei Indonesia
attributed split-ticket voters to the Ganjar-Mahfud pair's poor performance
despite the PDI-P's success in remaining the largest party in the
legislature.[199] Notably, Prabowo won the most votes in the traditionally
PDI-P supporting provinces of Central Java and Bali.[200] _Kompas'_ exit polls
found strong support for Prabowo's candidacy from non-Muslim voters and
Nahdlatul Ulama Muslims, winning in 36 of 38 provinces (except for Aceh and
West Sumatra, where the Anies-Muhaimin pair received the most votes).[201]
Anies-Muhaimin and Ganjar-Mahfud were also defeated in East Java and Central
Java, respectively, even though their supporting parties (PKB and PDI-P,
respectively) won the most votes in the two provinces.[202] Prabowo also won
the most votes in Bali, a traditional PDI-P stronghold, a victory attributed
by analysts and Prabowo's campaign team to Jokowi's endorsement.[203][204]

Nahdlatul Ulama-affiliated academic Ulil Abshar Abdalla [id], in a _Kompas_
column, attributed Prabowo's strong performance to Indonesian voters
prioritizing the continuation of Jokowi's policies over concerns on legal and
ethical violations.[205] On the other hand, Ganjar's campaign was described by
an ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute analysis as being left "without a clear
campaign message or identity" following Jokowi's split from PDI-P. The same
researchers noted Prabowo's success in changing his popular image from a
strongman in prior elections to a "cuddly grandpa" through social media
campaigns in order to appeal to younger generations.[206]

Of parties which qualified for the House of Representatives in 2019, Golkar
gained the most in 2024, increasing the party's vote share from 12 percent to
over 15 percent.[207] Parties supporting Ganjar Pranowo – PDI-P, PPP, Hanura
and Perindo – saw their vote shares decline from 2019, with PPP failing to
qualify for parliament for the first time since the party's first electoral
participation in the 1977 election.[208][209]

## Reactions

[edit]

###  Domestic

[edit]

Outgoing president Joko Widodo stated that he had met and congratulated
Prabowo and his own son, Gibran, on the evening of 14 February, based on quick
count results.[210] Former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono congratulated
Prabowo and stated that he "is now his commander".[211]

Chairman of the NasDem Party Surya Paloh in a press conference said his party
accepted the results of both legislative and presidential elections and
congratulated all winners of the legislative election and the Prabowo-Gibran
ticket.[212] Despite this, Paloh states that NasDem will continue to support
efforts to "seek justice" regarding the election results. NasDem will also
file a lawsuit against the election results, including for the election of
legislative members in six electoral districts, namely three electoral
districts in Sumatra, one electoral district in Papua, and two electoral
districts in Java.[213] The Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) also accepted the
results with party secretary general Aboe Bakar Alhabsy expressing his
happiness on its electoral gain of 3 seats.[214] However, PKS states that the
legal process for the election is still ongoing, citing the problems of using
the Sirekap.[214]

Anies Baswedan and Muhaimin Iskandar said that "It is important to safeguard
the election process to ensure legitimacy, trust and inclusiveness in the
results".[215] In an apparent criticism towards Gibran Rakabuming Raka's
candidacy as vice president, Anies stated that "leaders born from a process
tainted with fraud and irregularities will produce a regime that produces
policies full of injustice" and his team did not want this to happen.[215]
They initially rejected the results of the presidential election announced by
the KPU and protested the result to the Constitutional Court.[216] On 22 April
2024 after hearing the ruling from the Constitutional Court, Anies declared
that the election was over[217] and congratulated Prabowo and Gibran for their
victory in the election.[218]

Ganjar Pranowo's campaign legal team deputy leader Todung Mulya Lubis also
stated they would protest the results to the Constitutional Court and
rejecting the results of the presidential election especially on the PDI-P's
stronghold provinces of Central Java, Bali, North Sulawesi and East Nusa
Tenggara.[219] Despite this, Todung Mulya Lubis stated they were not in the
position to reject the whole results and only wanted to "correct the
errors".[219] PDI-P's coalition partner PPP also rejected the election
results, citing discrepancies between KPU's and the party's internal
results.[220] On 22 April 2024, following the ruling from the Constitutional
Court, both Ganjar Pranowo and Mahfud MD accepted the election results and
congratulated Prabowo and Gibran for their electoral victory.[221]

Grand Imam of the Istiqlal Mosque Nasaruddin Umar congratulated Prabowo and
Gibran on their victory in the election and expressed hope that Indonesia will
be more developed and more successful under their leadership.[222] Nahdlatul
Ulama chief Yahya Cholil Staquf congratulated Prabowo-Gibran for winning the
election and all parties that won seats in the legislative election.[223]
Muhammadiyah chief Haedar Nashir had also congratulated Prabowo-Gibran, hoping
that the elected pair have the spirit of a statesman in carrying out the
popular mandate.[224]

Sultan and Governor of Yogyakarta Hamengkubuwono X congratulated Prabowo-
Gibran for their electoral victory and expressed hope for their successful
administration.[225]
