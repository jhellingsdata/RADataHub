**Legislative elections** were held in Iran on 1 March 2024 for the first
round, and on 10 May 2024 for the second round.

They were held four years after the previous election in 2020.[2] The election
had a preregistration for the first time as a result of a 2023 law.[3]
Elections to the Assembly of Experts took place concurrently with the
legislative elections.

The elections had most moderate and reformist figures disqualified from polls.
Additionally, there was a historic low voter turnout of 41%, with 5% of the
ballots cast being deemed "invalid".[4]

## Electoral system

[edit]

Main article: Elections in Iran

The 290-seat Islamic Consultative Assembly consists of 285 directly elected
members and five seats reserved for the Zoroastrians, Jews, Assyrian and
Chaldean Christians and Armenians (one for Armenians in the north of Iran and
one for Armenians in the south).[5] The 285 directly elected seats were
elected from 196 single and multi-member constituencies. In single-member
constituencies, candidates had to receive at least 20% of the vote in the
first round to be elected; in cases where no candidate passed the threshold, a
second round is held between the top two candidates. In multi-member
constituencies, voters cast as many votes as there are seats available; if not
all seats are filled by candidates with at least 20% of the vote, a second
round is held with twice the number of candidates as there are seats to be
filled (or all the original candidates if there are fewer than double the
number of seats).[5]

### Qualifications

[edit]

As with the previous election, in order to qualify to stand as a candidate in
the election, in accordance with Iranian laws, a candidate must:[5]

  * Be an Iranian citizen;
  * Be a supporter of the Islamic Republic, pledging loyalty to the constitution;
  * Be a practicing Muslim (unless running to represent one of the religious minorities in Iran);
  * Not have a "notorious reputation;"
  * Be in good health, and between the ages of 30 and 75.

A candidate will be disqualified if he/she is found to be mentally impaired,
actively supporting the Shah or supporting political parties and organizations
deemed illegal or been charged with anti-government activity, converted to
another faith or has otherwise renounced the Islamic faith, have been found
guilty of corruption, treason, fraud, bribery, is an addict or trafficker or
have been found guilty of violating Sharia law.[5] Also, candidates must be
literate; candidates cannot have played a role in the pre-1979 government, be
large landowners, drug addicts or have convictions relating to actions against
the state or apostasy. Government ministers, members of the Guardian Council
and High Judicial Council are banned from running for office, as is the Head
of the Administrative Court of Justice, the Head of General Inspection, some
civil servants and religious leaders and any member of the armed forces.[5]

## Campaign

[edit]

Preregistration was held for seven days.[_when?_] A record-breaking 48,847
people registered as candidates in the election, who were then vetted by the
Guardian Council to run for election.[6][7][8][9][10] Of these candidates, 75%
were below the age of 50.[11] About 15,200 received final approval to run for
office, with reformists believed to constitute between 20 and 30 percent of
them.[12] The candidates also included 1,713 women, which was more than double
the number who competed in the last election, at 819.[13]

Candidates in the first round and in the second round had only one week to
publicly campaign, from 22 February until 29 February and from 2 May 2024 to 9
May 2024 respectively.[14]

## Turnout

[edit]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Iranian_couple.jpg/270px-
Iranian_couple.jpg)an Iranian couple after voting

A former minister of intelligence predicted that turnout may be low as the
population may distance themselves from the election due to recent
protests.[15] A survey released by the state-owned polling center ISPA on 29
February expected a turnout of 38.5 percent nationwide and 23.5 percent in
Tehran.[16] Actual turnout was at 41 percent, equivalent to about 25 million
voters and the lowest since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.[17] About five
percent of ballots cast were also declared "invalid".[4]

Prior to the vote, the newspaper _Kayhan_ claimed that the National Trust
Party and the Executives of Construction Party had signed up for the election.
In a report, the Islamic Coalition Party invited people to vote.[18][19]
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged for a strong turnout, saying that
"it is important to show the world that the nation is mobilised," and that
"the enemies of Iran want to see if the people are present." Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps commander Hossein Salami also urged people to
participate, saying that "every vote is like a missile that is fired into the
heart of our strongest enemies".[20] President Ebrahim Raisi urged the public
to make the elections “a glorious day for the Iranian nation.”[21] In what was
seen as an effort to boost turnout, members of the Iranian police were given
four days of incentive leave to cast their vote.[22]

President Ebrahim Raisi praised the considerably low turnout as an 'extreme
blow' to opponents of the Islamic Republic. However, Azar Mansouri, the head
of the Reform Front coalition of parties that boycotted the elections, called
for authorities to heed the voice of the silent majority and urged changes to
the governance method.[4]

## Conduct

[edit]

### Boycott calls

[edit]

About 275 prominent activists and civil society representatives called for a
boycott of the election, citing the "disgraceful" state of the electoral
system and the "complete elimination of opponents."[23] Among them was
imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate and women's rights activist Narges
Mohammadi, who called the vote a "sham".[16] The Reform Front also described
the vote as "meaningless, non-competitive and ineffective", while former
President Mohammad Khatami said that Iran was "very far from free and
competitive elections".[20] In West Azerbaijan province, 50 activists were
arrested for calling for a boycott of the election on social media.[22] Former
president Hassan Rouhani, who was disqualified from running in the Assembly of
Experts after being a member for 24 years, urged for a "protest vote" but did
not explicitly call for a boycott.[24]

### Opening hours

[edit]

During the first round, polls opened at 08:00 local time in 59,000 precincts
across the country and were initially set to run for ten hours before being
extended until midnight. Electronic voting was scheduled to be held in 1,700
polling stations across four constituencies. The Interior Ministry deployed
250,000 security personnel to ensure the conduct of the elections amid tighter
scrutiny in the aftermath of the 2024 Kerman bombings.[25][26][27] For the
second round, polling was held in 22 constituencies with 90 candidates seeking
to fill 45 seats in parliament. Sixteen of the contested seats were in Tehran,
with 32 candidates seeking positions there.[28]

Initial results revealed that a second round was required for 45 seats in the
Islamic Consultative Assembly, in a total of 15 provinces,[17] including the
constituency regrouping Tehran, Ray, Shemiran, Eslamshahr and Pardis, which
amount to thirty seats, among which 14 were filled in the first round.[4][29]
The second round was held on 10 May.[30]
