A presidential election is scheduled to be held in Croatia in December 2024,
with a second round in January 2025 if no candidate receives a majority.[11]
Incumbent president Zoran Milanović is eligible for a second term. His first
term began on 19 February 2020 and will end on 18 February 2025.[12]

## Background

[edit]

A presidential election will be held in the super-election year of 2024 during
which voters in Croatia had also voted for the Croatian Parliament in April
and European Parliament in June.[13]

The first round was planned for December 2024, but on 15 March 2024 incumbent
president Zoran Milanović announced he would run as a candidate of the Social
Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP) for the position of prime minister.[14]
During press conference he revealed his resignation as the president would
come "after election victory" in the parliamentary election on 17 April
2024.[15] In that case the first round could be held no later than 16 June
2024.[_citation needed_] However, the SDP coalition didn't win the elections,
so Milanović continued to hold the office of president.

## Electoral system

[edit]

The president of Croatia is directly elected by secret ballot to a term of
five years using the two-round system, with presidents limited to two full
terms in office. The constitution requires that a presidential election be
held no sooner than 60 days and no later than 30 days before the expiration of
the incumbent president's term. An absolute majority (50% + 1 vote) of all
votes cast (including invalid, blank and uncast ballots) is required to win in
the first round. If no candidate receives a majority of the vote, a second-
round is to be held fourteen days later, with the two candidates with the
highest number of votes in the first round taking part. The candidate who
receives the highest number of votes in the second round (a majority of valid
votes cast) is declared the winner. If one of the candidates who has qualified
for the second round were to withdraw their candidacy or die, the candidate
with the next highest number of votes in the first round takes their place in
the second round.[16]

In order for a potential candidate to be allowed to contest the elections and
have their name placed on the ballot, they must gather at least 10,000
signatures from eligible voters, with every signatory being permitted to give
their signature to only one potential candidate. The timeframe for collecting
the said number of signatures is set at twelve days, and after the expiry of
this period potential candidates must submit them to the State Electoral
Commission for verification.[17]
