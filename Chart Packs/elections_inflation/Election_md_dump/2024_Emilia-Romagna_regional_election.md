The **2024 Emilia-Romagna regional election** will take place in Emilia-
Romagna, Italy, on 17–18 November 2024.[1]

The elections were called following Stefano Bonaccini's election to the
European Parliament, a position incompatible with his post as the regional
president. He resigned on 12 July 2024, on the same day, the Democratic Party
unanimously nominated Mayor of Ravenna Michele De Pascale as its candidate.[2]
On 25 July, the centre-right coalition announced the candidacy of Elena
Ugolini, a former undersecretary of state and school principal, without a
party affiliation.[3]

## Electoral system

[edit]

In Emilia-Romagna, a new electoral law was approved by the Legislative
Assembly in July 2014, abolishing the blocked list.

The voter can express one or two preference votes for the candidates on the
chosen list; in the case of the expression of two preferences, these must
concern candidates of different sex according to "gender preference" (under
penalty of annulment of the second preference). As regards the election of the
councilors, the law guarantees in any case at least 27 seats on the lists that
support the elected president (majority prize), obtaining effects that are
very similar to those of the list but acting on the provincial lists. The
first 40 seats are distributed on a proportional basis. A seat is then
attributed to the candidate for president who came second. The remaining 9
seats are assigned by majority method to the lists that support the elected
president if these lists have obtained less than 25 seats with the previous
procedure, otherwise the "prize" will be only 4 seats. If, at the end of these
assignments, the majority lists have not obtained at least 27 seats, these
will be guaranteed by removing some of the seats already assigned to the
opposition lists.
