**Presidential elections** were held in Iceland on 1 June 2024.[1][2]
Incumbent president Guðni Th. Jóhannesson announced that he would not seek a
third term.[1] Entrepreneur Halla Tómasdóttir was elected as his successor[3]
and took office on 1 August.[4]

## Background

[edit]

The previous presidential elections on 27 June 2020 saw incumbent president
Guðni Th. Jóhannesson re-elected for a second four-year term with 92% of the
vote, over Guðmundur Franklín Jónsson.[5] The office of President is not term-
limited; however, despite being eligible to serve a third term, Guðni
announced in his New Year's address to the Icelandic people on 1 January 2024
that he would not stand for re-election again.[6]

## Electoral system

[edit]

The President of Iceland is directly elected by first-past-the-post voting,
with a simple plurality of votes needed to win.[7] Candidates must be
Icelandic citizens and at least 35 years of age on election day.[8]

On election day, polling opened at 09:00 and ran until 22:00.[9]

## Candidates

[edit]

Prospective presidential candidates had until 26 April 2024 to collect more
than 1,500 voter signatures to secure ballot access.[10] Eighty candidates
sought voter signatures by that date. The following individuals have received
media attention for their potential candidacy for the position of president.
On 29 April 2024, the National Electoral Commission announced which candidates
had secured ballot access.

## Campaign issues

Presidential debates have featured Iceland's membership in NATO, military aid
for Ukraine, the possible sale of the state energy firm Landsvirkjun and the
use of veto powers by the Presidency. Questions were also raised on whether
Katrín Jakobsdóttir's background as a politician and prime minister would
affect her tenure in office, to which she said that she "can rise above party
politics".[10] Halla Tómasdóttir ran her campaign on issues such as the
effects of social media on the mental health of youth, tourism development and
the role of artificial intelligence.[55]
