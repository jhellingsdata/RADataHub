Snap parliamentary elections were held in Bulgaria on 27 October 2024,[1][2]
after all three attempts to form a government following the latest June 2024
elections failed. This was the country's sixth snap election since 2021. This
series of snap elections is the result of a political crisis affecting the
country.

## Background

[edit]

See also: 2021–present Bulgarian political crisis, 2023 Bulgarian
parliamentary election, and June 2024 Bulgarian parliamentary election

### Elections and government breakdown

[edit]

Following several snap elections, the National Assembly had failed to put
together a long-lasting government since 'anti-corruption' parties made a
breakthrough in the April 2021 election.[3][4] The 2023 election saw little
change from 2022, with Boyko Borisov's centre-right GERB–SDS narrowly coming
in first place, above the centrist PP–DB alliance. The far-right Revival (VAZ)
and the populist There is Such a People (ITN) made gains, with the latter re-
entering the Assembly after it failed to reach the electoral threshold in
2022.[5][6]

On 22 May 2023 the PP- and GERB-led alliances agreed to form a government with
a rotational premiership. Nikolai Denkov, PP's candidate, would be the Prime
Minister for the first nine months of the government and Mariya Gabriel, the
GERB candidate, would serve as deputy prime minister and foreign affairs
minister. After nine months, the two would switch positions.[7] After nine
months, the switch failed to materialise with negotiations breaking
down,[8][9][10][11] and no government could be formed. Dimitar Glachev was
appointed as caretaker prime minister,[12] and elections were scheduled for 9
June 2024.[13][14]

### June elections

[edit]

The June 2024 elections, held at the same time as the European Parliament
elections, had the lowest turnout (33%) since the end of communist rule in
1989.[3] It resulted in GERB–SDS winning most of the votes and 68 seats, with
no party or alliance obtaining enough seats to form a majority in the National
Assembly.[15] The new elected 50th Parliament replaced the 49th
Parliament,[16] when all elected members were sworn in on 19 June.[17]
Government formation attempts were given to GERB, PP–DB and There is Such a
People (ITN), with the final attempt failing on 5 August.[18][19][20]

As a consequence, Bulgarian President Rumen Radev instead appointed the Vice
President of the Bulgarian National Audit Office, Goritsa Grancharova-
Kozhareva, as the next caretaker prime minister on 9 August.[21] Grancharova-
Kozhareva was granted ten days to form a proposal for the next caretaker
government to be appointed on 20 August, and the upcoming next parliamentary
elections were scheduled for 20 October 2024.[22] Grancharova-Kozhareva made
the controversial decision to propose that the incumbent minister of the
interior, Kalin Stoyanov, should remain in his role, but this was opposed by
President Radev. Radev rejected the government proposal, delaying the upcoming
election.[23]

Following the rejection of Grancharova-Kozhareva, Radev re-appointed Dimitar
Glavchev as the caretaker prime minister,[24] and his government proposal was
sworn in on 27 August, and the elections were set for the 27 October.[25][26]

### Changes in the Assembly's composition prior to the election

[edit]

One MP was expelled from the BSP by its national council on 18 June, before
being sworn in.[27]

The Velichie parliamentary group comprised 13 MPs after the election. On 5
July, six MPs broke away from the group, dissolving it.[28]

A rift in Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) surrounding Delyan Peevski
saw 17 MPs expelled and a further eight leave.[29]

As of the end of July 2024, the composition of the Assembly was as follows:

**Composition of the50th Parliament

     BSPzB (17 MPs)
     ITN (16 MPs)
     Independents expelled from DPS

(7 MPs, led by Nikolay Markov (politician) [bg])[28]

     Independents from the dissolved Velichie  
(6 MPs, led by Ivelin Mikhailov [bg])[28]

     Independent expelled from BSPzB  
(2 MPs, Kaloyan Metodiev [bg] and Mikhail Stavrev)[27]  
---  
  
## Electoral system

[edit]

The 240 members of the National Assembly were elected by open list,
proportional representation from 31 multi-member constituencies ranging in
size from four to nineteen seats. The electoral threshold was 4% for all
parties or electoral coalitions, with seats allocated according to the largest
remainder method using a Hare quota.[31][32]

## Parties

[edit]

### Contesting parties and coalitions

[edit]

Below is the official list of parties and coalitions that registered lists for
the Bulgarian Parliamentary elections.[33][34] Boxes shaded in grey are not
officially parties, but key groups in each alliance.

It was reported that despite suggesting they could run, Volt, Bulgarian
National Union and VMRO did not submit their lists in time to partake in the
elections.[35] NDPS also wished to partake, but its registration was
deleted.[36]

### DPS leadership dispute

[edit]

On 27 August, the central leadership organisation of the DPS removed Delyan
Peevski as chairman of the party, and seven MPs close to Peevski were expelled
from the party. This move has been linked to Ahmed Dogan, MP and honorary
chairman of the party.[37][38][39] Peevski called the move
unconstitutional,[8] and gained control of the official party website.[40]
This follows the rift in the party following the election, where the
parliamentary group split.[29] The controversy surrounding Peevski has led to
two groups emerging,[41] DPS – A New Beginning[42] and Democracy, Rights and
Freedoms,[43] with both groups registering as electoral coalitions with the
acronym DPS in order to get around the rules of the electoral
commission.[6][44] After DPS–Peevski was recognized to be the legitimate DPS
by the Supreme Administrative Court of Bulgaria, DPS–Dogan changed their name
to "Alliance for Rights and Freedoms" (АПС instead of ДПС) and registered
without listing DPS as a member of the alliance.[45] The DPS mayors split
50:50 between both groups.[46]

## Campaign

[edit]

Ten days prior to the election, it was reported that 1.2 million BGN (US
$680k) was spent on advertising in the media, with ITN spending the most,
DPS–Peevski second most, and BPS–OL third.[47]

## Conduct

[edit]

Allegations of vote buying are common occurrences in the Bulgarian electoral
cycle,[49] with allegations of vote buying happening more often in rural
areas, which have more poverty and people who are less educated.[50] During
the election campaign, a deputy, Ivaylo Mirchev, from PP–DB, claimed that
there was widespread vote buying being conducted by DPS–Peevski, claiming
people were being paid up to 500 BGN (US $286) per vote.[51] One of the
leaders of the list for DPS–Peevski appeared to admit to vote buying in a
social media poll.[52]

The interior minister, Atanas Ilkov, told a parliamentary hearing that he had
received two alerts of vote buying by 25 September.[53] A national police
operation that was set up to target the practice began operating two days
later.[54] On 18 October, Ilkov said his ministry had received 259 allegations
of vote buying.[55]

Deutsche Welle received reports, especially in Kardzhali Province, that
DPS–Peevski was pressuring people to vote for the party in fear of losing
their jobs, with already 60 jobs lost in the municipal administration. They
also reported that Peevski personally was paying for various small-scale
public repairs.[56]

### Dzheyhan Ibryamov case

[edit]

On 2 October, the lead candidate of DPS–Dogan in Shumen, Dzheyhan Ibryamov,
was arrested by the Prosecutors Office on the charge of attempting to buy vote
and influence peddling.[57] Following a request by the Prosecutors Office, the
CEC and Chairwoman of the National Assembly, Raya Nazaryan, agreed to lift
Ibryamov's immunity as a candidate in the elections.[58] Despite the criminal
case against him and his arrest, Ibryamov was still authorised to participate
in the elections.[59]

The arrest and criminal prosecution of Ibryamov provoked negative reactions
from key DPS–Dogan figures, with the coalition _de facto_ leader, Dzhevdet
Chakarov, calling for the cancellation of the upcoming elections.[60]

### Post-result reports

[edit]

In identified polling stations with a risk of high levels of controlled or
bought votes, GERB and DPS–Peevski were the leading parties.[61]

According to the Institute for the Development of the Public Environment,
there were 827 polling stations with this risk, and bTV reported some voters
in Blagoevgrad did not deny that there was vote buying occurring.[62] The
coordinator of the 'You Count' organisation, which asks voters to report
election misconduct, claimed that there were entire municipalities at risk of
high levels of bought and controlled votes. He claimed the results did not
reflect the will of the Bulgarian citizens because the results were so
skewed.[63]

An investigation was released on the state broadcaster, BNT, claimed to show
that discrepancies of up to 100 votes in one electoral district, as well as
other malpractices elsewhere.[64]

The Caretaker Government, in its official report, stated that they believe
that the elections had taken place in a free and fair environment, and cited
positive comments made by international electoral observers.[65] In a briefing
shortly after the elections, Caretaker Minister of the Interior Atanas Ilkov
claimed that no serious differences in the level of vote-buying had been noted
by the Ministry and that there was no evidence of the use of state
institutions in order to influence the elections outcome.[66]

## Results

[edit]

Exit polls showed a GERB victory with 26.4% of the vote, with the PP getting
14.9%, and Revival 12.9%.[67]

The following table outlines the partial results by party. The national
threshold at 4% is calculated using total votes for parties and independent
candidates only, and not the total of valid votes, which include "None of the
above" votes. Velichie missed out on reaching the electoral threshold by less
than 30 votes, and therefore lost its parliamentary representation.

As of 22:03 Eastern European Time (UTC+02:00) on 27 October 2024, exit polls
showed GERB–SDS was projected to win 65 to 76 seats, with PP–DB securing 37 to
42 seats and Revival claiming 35 to 36 seats. Parallel vote tabulation showed
slightly different projections: 63 to 69 for GERB–SDS, 35 to 38 for PP–DB and
35 to 36 for Revival.[68]

## Aftermath

[edit]

### Government formation

[edit]

Following the results, the parliament remained fragmented, with no clear pre-
existing majority being evident.[69]

Borisov, GERB's leader, claimed victory following the elections and declared
that he would be willing to cooperate with all parties except for Revival, if
they were willing to support GERB's program.[70]

PP–DB, which finished second, called for a cordon sanitaire around
DPS–Peevski, and urged all parties to sign an agreement to this effect, which
would also include a committment to support anti-corruption legislation and
judicial reform. PP co-leader Kiril Petkov stated that signing this joint-
declaration was a pre-condition for their negotiation with any of the other
parties.[71] The call to exclude Peevski from future governing arrangements
was supported by DPS–Dogan,[72] which pushed for a Euro-Atlanticist majority
without DPS–Peevski.[73] Specifically, Dogan himself said his DPS wing could
support a GERB–PP–DB government.[74] ITN also supported the statement on the
condition that PP–DB would agree to fix the electoral rolls,[75] which they
did.[76] GERB rejected the concept of signing agreements prior to
negotiations.[77] Peevski, for his part, argued that the attempts to exclude
his party were undemocratic and implied that they were an attempt to sideline
the interests of Bulgarian ethnic minority voters.[78]

The BSP, in a statement after the election, did not explicitly rule out
participation in a government with any of the other parliamentary represented
parties, however made clear that any decision about government participation
would have to be taken by all parts of the party and broader coalition.[79]

The leader of the newest parliamentary party, MECh, Radostin Vasilev initially
proposed a coalition excluding GERB and both wings of the DPS, where MECh
would take the interior ministry.[80]

#### Coalition options

[edit]

The Bulgarian news network _Dnevnik_ suggested the following options were
possibilities following the results and considering the positions of the
parties:[81]

Coalition Partners  | Seats  | Status in the National Assembly  | Notes   
---|---|---|---  
GERB, PP–DB, APS  |  69+37+19   
  
  
| Majority (125/240)  
GERB, PP–DB, BSP  |  69+37+20   
  
  
| Majority (126/240)  |   
GERB, PP–DB, ITN  |  69+37+18   
  
  
| Majority (124/240)  |   
GERB, PP–DB, BSP, APS, ITN  |  69+37+20+19+18   
  
| Qualified majority (163/240)  | This coalition could exclude one of the latter three parties and still retain a majority.   
GERB, BSP, APS, ITN  |  69+20+19+18   
  
| Majority (126/240)  |   
GERB  |  69   
  
  
  
| Minority (69/240)  | A minority GERB cabinet, which would require 62 votes in favour and a majority including abstentions.   
  
#### Election of the speaker

[edit]

The election of the speaker of the National Assembly was previously used as
GERB as a key part of coalition negotiations. GERB again declared that as the
largest party, they should elect the speaker and his party would not partake
in coalition talks if this was not to be the case.[82] PP–DB had previously
stated they would not vote to elect a GERB speaker.[83]

### Contestation of the results and election conduct

[edit]

Velichie, which according to the results remained just below the 4% threshold,
alleged that the elections had been rigged against them and promised to
contest the election results.[84] They specifically accused GERB and
DPS–Peevski of electoral fraud.[85] The party staged protests in Sofia for
multiple days in a row calling for the annulment of the results.[86] There
were reports that enough votes to put Velichie into the Assembly were
misallocated to other parties in the vote count.[87]

The conduct of the election had allegations of mass vote buying and voter
manipulation, leading civil society organisations to call for the annulment of
the results.[88] President Rumen Radev noted the large amount of evidence
supporting allegations of mass vote buying and called on the Ministry of
Interior to reveal which parties were most complicit in the practice.[89] ITN
leader Slavi Trifonov endorsed Radev's calls and additionally called for the
resignation of the Caretaker Government due to their mishandling of the
elections.[90] The BSP similarly called on the Prosecutors Office to respond
to the allegations of mass vote buying and irregularities.[91] PP–DB said they
wanted a comprehensive check of the results, pointing to irregularities like
high turnout, high numbers of invalid ballots and discrepancies.[92]

The following parties have called for a full or partial annullment of the
election: BSP,[93] DPS–Dogan,[72] GERB,[94] ITN,[95] MECh,[96] and
Velichie.[84] Multiple parties also announced they would collect signatures to
send a partial annullment case to the Constitutional Court, which requires the
support of 48 MPs.[95][93]
