Snap regional elections were held in Madeira on 26 May 2024, to determine the
composition of the Legislative Assembly of the Autonomous Region of Madeira.
The election replaced all 47 members of the Madeira Assembly, and the new
members will then elect the President of the Autonomous Region.

Before the dissolution of the regional parliament, incumbent president Miguel
Albuquerque, since 2015, from the Social Democratic Party (PSD), led a
coalition government between the Social Democrats and the CDS – People's
Party, with the parliamentary support of People Animals Nature. The Social
Democrats defended their dominance in the islands, which they have held since
1976.

The Social Democratic Party (PSD), marred in an ongoing corruption
investigation, emerged, once again, as the winner with 36 percent of the
votes, albeit losing one seat thus gathering 19 seats, but polling comfortably
ahead of the second most voted party, the PS.[1]

The Socialist Party (PS) suffered another big defeat by gathering basically
the same number of votes and seats as in September 2023, 21 percent and eleven
seats, thus making no gains from the Social Democrats situation.[2] The
Together for the People (JPP) can be considered as the big winner of the
elections, by gathering 17 percent of the votes, very close with the
Socialists, and winning 9 seats, four more than in 2023. The party was also
the most voted in their stronghold of Santa Cruz.[3]

CHEGA didn't make significant gains and won 9 percent of the votes and held on
to the 4 seats won in September 2023. CDS – People's Party (CDS–PP), now
running alone after their "quarrel" with the PSD, achieved 4 percent of the
votes and won 2 seats, minus one they had in their 2023 coalition with the
Social Democrats.[4]

People-Animals-Nature (PAN) and the Liberal Initiative (IL) held on to their
sole seats, while the Left Bloc (BE) lost their seat and left the regional
assembly, as did the Unitary Democratic Coalition (CDU), which for the first
time in 32 years failed to win a seat in the Madeira assembly.[5]

The turnout in these elections was the same as in September 2023, with 53.4
percent of voters casting a ballot, compared with the 53.3 percent eight
months before.

## Background

[edit]

In the 2023 regional election, the We Are Madeira coalition (PSD/CDS–PP) was
again the most voted coalition, 43 percent, but failed to win an absolute
majority.[6] After the elections, PSD and CDS–PP sought the parliamentary
support from PAN, which guaranteed an absolute majority in the regional
parliament.[7]

### 2024 corruption investigation

[edit]

On 24 January 2024, the Judiciary Police and the Public Prosecutor's office
conducted a series of searches at the official office of the President of the
Region, at Funchal City Hall, at Miguel Albuquerque's private residence and in
many private companies, regarding corruption and abuse of power accusations
surrounding real estate businesses in the region.[8] The mayor of Funchal,
Pedro Calado, and two businessmen were arrested by the police.[9] Miguel
Albuquerque was named as formal suspect and is accused of several corruption,
abuse of power and influence peddling crimes.[10]

Miguel Albuquerque announced he would not resign as President and would defend
himself against the accusations, although suggesting that he would ask his
double immunity, granted as a member of the regional government and the
Council of State, to be removed, pressing that he is innocent.[11] Parties
reacted by demanding Albuquerque's resignation, with People Animals Nature
(PAN) threatening to tear apart the agreement between them and the PSD, if
Albuquerque didn't resign.[12] The Socialist Party (PS) and Chega announced
intentions of submitting motions of no confidence against Albuquerque.[13]

#### Fall of the government

[edit]

On 26 January, Miguel Albuquerque announced he would resign as President of
the regional government of Madeira.[14] The PSD was expected to select a new
leader that would become President of the Regional Government of Madeira.[15]
Following Albuquerque's resignation, PAN announced that it would continue to
provide parliamentary support to PSD.[16] However, divisions within the PSD
meant that a consensus on a succession solution was not reached.[17] The
Representative of the Republic in Madeira, Ireneu Barreto, then started to
hear parties represented in the regional Parliament.[18] Opposition parties,
PS, JPP, CH, PCP, IL and BE defended snap elections, while PSD, CDS–PP and PAN
proposed the nomination of a new government.[19]

On 17 February, the Representative of the Republic in Madeira announced that
he would keep the government in office, in a caretaker capacity, until the
President of Portugal decided whether there would be early elections or a new
government under the current parliament. The parliament of Madeira could only
be dissolved from 24 March 2024 onwards, six months after the last
elections.[20]

On 27 March, the President of Portugal decided to dissolve the regional
parliament and call early elections for 26 May.[21]

### Leadership changes and challenges

[edit]

#### Socialist Party

[edit]

On 2 December 2023, a leadership election was held to replace Sérgio Gonçalves
as the leader of PS Madeira. Paulo Cafôfo, by then Secretary of State for the
Portuguese Communities and former Mayor of Funchal was the only candidate. He
was elected with 98.6 percent of the votes.[22]

Ballot: 2 December 2023  Candidate  | Votes  | %   
---|---|---  
| Paulo Cafôfo | 1,450  | 98.6   
Blank/Invalid ballots  | 20  | 1.4   
**Turnout** | **1,470** |

#### Social Democratic Party

[edit]

On 19 February 2024, Miguel Albuquerque announced that a PSD leadership
election would held on 21 March 2024, with himself being an almost certain
candidate, which was later confirmed.[23] The party also announced the end of
their coalition with CDS–People's Party and would contest future elections
alone.[24] Manuel António Correia, former regional secretary of the
Environment and Natural Resources from 2000 to 2015, announced his intention
to run, being supported by former President Alberto João Jardim.[25] On 21
March 2024, Albuquerque was reelected with 54 percent of the votes, against
the 45 percent of António Correia.[26] 4,388 party members were able to vote,
just over a third of a total universe of more than 12,000 members, and of
those able to vote, 94 percent cast a ballot. The results were the following:

Ballot: 21 March 2024  Candidate  | Votes  | %   
---|---|---  
| Miguel Albuquerque | 2,243  | 54.3   
| Manuel António Correia | 1,856  | 44.9   
Blank/Invalid ballots  | 33  | 0.8   
**Turnout** | **4,132** | **94.17**  
Source: Expresso  
  
#### CDS – People's Party

[edit]

On 20 February 2024, CDS–PP party leader and Regional Secretary for Economic
Affairs, Rui Barreto, announced his resignation from the party leadership,[27]
and a leadership ballot was called for April. José Manuel Rodrigues, President
of the Regional Assembly and former leader of CDS–PP Madeira (1997–2018),
announced his intention to run for the leadership.[28] On 14 April 2024, José
Manuel Rodrigues was easily elected as party leader with 76 percent of the
delegates votes:[29]

Ballot: 14 April 2024  Candidate  | Votes  | %   
---|---|---  
| José Manuel Rodrigues | 129  | 75.9   
Blank/Invalid ballots  | 41  | 24.1   
**Turnout** | **170** |

## Electoral system

[edit]

The current 47 members of the Madeiran regional parliament are elected in a
single constituency by proportional representation under the D'Hondt method,
coinciding with the territory of the Region.[30]

## Campaign

[edit]

### Issues

[edit]

The campaign was dominated by issues like housing, poverty and lack of
freedoms in Madeira, with some parties accusing the PSD of coercing public
employees.[34] The stability of the next regional government was also a big
issue in the campaign, with Miguel Albuquerque being rejected by all parties,
due to his ongoing corruption accusations, and with the Socialists hoping to
forge a "contraption" with left wing parties, in order to end the Social
Democrats 48 years in power.[35]

## Opinion polls

[edit]

Polls that show their results without distributing those respondents who are
undecided or said they would abstain from voting, are re-calculated by
removing these numbers from the totals through a simple rule of three, in
order to obtain results comparable to other polls and the official election
results.

Most voted political force by municipality.

## Aftermath

[edit]

On election night, Miguel Albuquerque, PSD leader, said the Social Democrats
had a clear victory, that the leftwing had a "copious defeat" and that the
party was ready to govern in dialogue with other parties.[51] Socialist Party
leader Paulo Cafôfo said that the results showed that an alternative
government was possible.[52] Together for the People (JPP), considered the big
winners of the election, said that stability scenarios were on the making and
asked for the confidence of voters.[53] Other parties, however, didn't seem
willing into supporting either Albuquerque or Cafôfo, with Chega suggesting
that only the resignation of Albuquerque would allow Chega to support the PSD;
CDS–PP not open to coalitions but to dialogue case by case with the PSD, and
rejecting any deal with the Socialists, the same position as the Liberal
Initiative; PAN said they would be a constructive force in Parliament.[52]

On the day after election day, on 27 May, PS and JPP announced a compromise to
propose an alternative government and called on other parties to join
them.[54] The Liberal Initiative rejected any possibility of joining the PS
and JPP compromise.[55] On the next day, on 28 May, PSD and CDS–PP reached a
deal,[56] plus assured the abstention of Chega.[57] After meeting with parties
represented in the regional assembly, also during 28 May, the Representative
of the Republic, Ireneu Barreto, nominated Miguel Albuquerque as President of
the Regional Government.[58] The new government was sworn in on 6 June
2024.[59]

The government programme was given to the Regional Parliament, by Albuquerque,
on 14 June and was set to be discussed and voted during three days, between 18
and 20 June 2024.[60] However, despite previous certainties given by Miguel
Albuquerque, there were doubts if the programme would pass in the Regional
Parliament as Chega announced they would vote against it, alongside the
Socialists.[61] JPP, shortly after, also announced its vote against the
programme.[62] With an imminent rejection, Albuquerque withdrew, on 19 June,
his programme from the assembly and announced negotiations to present a new
one, thus cancelling the 20 June vote.[63] After several days of negotiations
with Opposition parties, mainly Chega, IL, CDS–PP and PAN, Miguel Albuquerque
presented, on 2 July, a second government programme that was set to be
discussed and voted on 4 July, however with its fate being seen as
unclear.[64]

### Government approval

[edit]

On 4 July 2024, the regional assembly approved the PSD minority government
with the votes in favour of PSD, CDS–PP and PAN; PS, JPP and one Chega member
Magna Costa voting against; and the abstention of IL and the remaining three
members from Chega.
