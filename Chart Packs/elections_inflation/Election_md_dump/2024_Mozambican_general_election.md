General elections were held in Mozambique on 9 October 2024 to elect the
president, the 250 members of the Assembly of the Republic and members of the
ten provincial assemblies.[1][2][3]

The ruling FRELIMO party, which has increasingly become marked with growing
concerns of authoritarianism and impunity amid the controversies surrounding
the 2023 local elections and the 2019 general election,[4] was declared the
winner of the election, with its leader, Daniel Chapo, proclaimed as
president-elect. This was disputed by Venâncio Mondlane, with his party
PODEMOS claiming Mondlane had received 53% of the vote using data from their
poll observers. The result was also questioned by the Episcopal Conference of
Mozambique and the European Union, while deadly protests broke out over the
election results, with at least 10 protesters being killed by police forces.

## Background

[edit]

FRELIMO, which has ruled the country since 1975 when they created a one-party
Marxist–Leninist state, allowed multi-party elections as part of the peace
process that ended the Mozambican Civil War in 1994; however, the opposition
has decried these elections as rigged in FRELIMO's favor. After the 2023 local
elections protests broke out due to alleged fraud on the part of FRELIMO with
the police killing at least three protesters. Public perceptions of the
election were muted, as many view a FRELIMO victory as a foregone
conclusion.[5]

## Electoral system

[edit]

The president is elected using the two-round system.[6] The 250 members of the
Assembly of the Republic are elected by proportional representation in eleven
multi-member constituencies based on the country's provinces and on a first-
past-the-post basis from two single-member constituencies representing
Mozambican citizens in Africa and Europe. Seats in the multi-member
constituencies are allocated using the d'Hondt method, with an electoral
threshold of 5%.[7] Official results are announced by the National Election
Commission (CNE) after 15 days and must subsequently be validated by the
Constitutional Council.[8]

Concerns have been raised over discrepancies in the total number of registered
voters, which stands at more than 17 million.[9] The non-governmental
organisation Centro de Integridade Pública, citing data published by the CNE,
said that there are 878,868 more registered voters than there are voting age
adults in some provinces, leading them to describe 5% of the electorate as
"ghost voters". The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral
Assistance also notes the existence of "ghost voters" in seven of the
country's ten provinces, with up to a third of the registered voting
population in Gaza Province believed to be non-existent.[10]

## Candidates

[edit]

On 5 May 2024, after a meeting of its Central Committee, FRELIMO named Daniel
Chapo, a 47-year old law professor and former governor of Inhambane Province,
as its candidate in the upcoming election to succeed outgoing president Filipe
Nyusi.[11] Chapo is the first presidential candidate of FRELIMO who was born
after Mozambique gained independence in 1975.[10]

On the same date, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) selected its
leader, Lutero Simango [d], to be its candidate for the October elections.[12]

Other candidates include Ossufo Momade, the leader of the RENAMO party since
2018 who had lost in the 2019 presidential election to Nyusi, and Venâncio
Mondlane, a banker and forestry engineer[8] who ran as an independent after
breaking away from RENAMO following an unsuccessful bid in the mayoral
election in Maputo in 2023 that was marred by allegations of electoral
fraud.[10] Mondlane was supported by the newly established Optimist Party for
the Development of Mozambique (PODEMOS), as well as the Democratic Alliance, a
coalition of opposition parties that were barred from contesting the
election.[13][14] Mondlane was registered as the PODEMOS party's presidential
candidate for this election.[15][16] Also, the president of the PODEMOS party,
Albino Forquilha, said that he allows for the possibility of Mondlane becoming
the party leader in the future.[17]

## Campaign

[edit]

Campaigning was held from August to 6 October.[18] Both Chapo and Mondlane
also made campaign stops in neighbouring South Africa, appealing to overseas
voters there.[10] All three candidates named the resolution of the Insurgency
in Cabo Delgado as their main priority.[18] Chapo was seen as the favorite to
win the election.[5] Independent candidate Venâncio Mondlane was seen as the
biggest challenge to Chapo.[19]

## Conduct

[edit]

The Southern African Development Community sent 52 election observers to
monitor the election.[18] Observers were also deployed by the African Union
and the European Union.[19] However, more than 200 polling stations denied
journalists and observers access to the vote counting process with the
election watchdog group Sala da Paz stating: "There were significant cases of
.... electoral irregularities that may raise questions about the credibility
of the process."[20]

Polling opened at 07:00 and closed at 18:00.[21] Chapo's rivals alleged
instances of fraud such as ballot boxes being unsealed before voting ended and
some of their representatives being denied accreditation to monitor the
vote.[19]

## Results

[edit]

### President

[edit]

Opposition candidate Venâncio Mondlane preemptively declared himself
victor.[22]

By 16 October preliminary reports showed Chapo in the lead.[23] On 24 October,
the CNE announced that Chapo won the election with 71% of the vote, while
turnout was at 43%. It also said that FRELIMO won in all provincial elections
and won 195 of the 250 seats in parliament, with PODEMOS winning 31 seats and
RENAMO winning 20.[24] PODEMOS disputed the results, publishing their own
parallel count from their election monitors which showed Mondlane won with 53%
of the vote and the party won 138 seats. PODEMOS provided over 660 pounds of
tabulated ballots to support their election count.[25]

## Aftermath

[edit]

While counting was underway on 11 October, Venâncio Mondlane threatened to
launch a nationwide strike if FRELIMO declared victory.[26] That same day,
observers from the European Union and the European Parliament demanded that
central election authorities release all voting details from all voting
places. Despite having the data, the central election authorities have refused
to do so.[27] The EU observers later said that there had been "irregularities
during counting and unjustified alteration of election results at polling
station and district level".[28] Mondlane later set the strike to begin on 21
October. On 16 October, four people were arrested during a march led by
Mondlane in Nampula.[29] Observers from the US-based International Republican
Institute also noted instances of voter intimidation, vote-buying and inflated
voter rolls in FRELIMO strongholds.[30]

On 14 October, Lutero Simango [d] and the Democratic Movement of Mozambique
announced that they would be rejecting any official vote count due to "many
irregularities and manipulation" and would be officially challenging the
election in court. One of the main issues the MDM have had with the election
is one of their voters was arrested without charge in a polling place in
Ribáuè. The MDM also announced that they were conducting a parallel vote count
which they will release when the official vote is released for comparison.[31]

On 16 October the Attorney General of Mozambique summoned Venâncio Mondlane
for violating the Mozambican Constitution, arguing that Mondlane and his
supporters performed "electoral offences, irregularities, common crimes and
the violation[s] of ethical-electoral norms." Mondlane had claimed victory
which the Attorney General classified as "incite[ing] violence, [and] public
disorder". Mondlane is also publishing results from his parallel vote count
which the attorney general classified as "behavior that violates ethical and
electoral principles and norms."[22]

On 17 October Angolan writer José Eduardo Agualusa criticized Venâncio
Mondlane for "an attitude of little democratic maturity" and that Mondlane was
trying to "subvert the constitution." Agualusa also called on the ruling
government to hold Mondlane "accountable for those statements" and that his
strong performance, even though he did not win, was “the great revolution” of
the current age and as such he needs to be more responsible. Agualusa also
said that "Renamo, in fact, is the big loser in this process."[32]

The Mozambican police reported that on election day there where 38 cases of
electoral crimes resulting in the arrest of 37 individuals. It also reported
60 electoral offenses resulting in 39 arrests from the period of 24 August to
6 October.[33] On 18 October, Elvino Dias, a lawyer working for PODEMOS and
one of Mondlane's advisors, was shot dead in his car along with the party's
spokesperson, Paulo Guambe, by unidentified attackers in Maputo.[34] At the
time of his death, Dias was preparing to submit a case to the constitutional
court contesting the result. Mondlane accused the security forces of
responsibility, while the EU, the African Union, the United States and
Portugal condemned the killings.[28] On 21 October, police fired tear gas at
Mondlane while he was giving out interviews at the site of Dias and Guambe's
murders. Mondlane said that police tried to prevent him from going outside to
participate in protests. Protests also broke out in Maputo, Beira, Nampula and
Gaza Province that same day as part of the strike called on by Mondlane,
resulting in the arrest of six people and injuries to 16 people including two
journalists.[35][36][30]

On 23 October the European Union observers released a statement that the
government performed "unjustified alteration" and that the results of the
election had been doctored in FRELIMO's favor while the U.S State Department
demanded an investigation and rejected political violence.[37] Additionally,
the Episcopal Conference of Mozambique urged election officials to not
"certify a lie" with Archbishop Inácio Saure saying that certifying Chapo as
victor was a "lie" and "fraud" while also saying "Mozambique must not return
to violence."[38] On 24 October, Mozambique's US dollar bonds dropped due to a
massive selloff while the opposition called for a "revolution."[39]

On 25 October riots broke out across the country after the government
announced that Chapo won and closed the border crossing with South Africa at
Ressano Garcia. Makeshift barriers blocked main roads in Maputo, with
protesters claiming they have "nothing to lose" due to the poor economic state
the country has been in since TotalEnergies SE delayed the construction of a
$20 billion natural gas plant due to the insurgency in Cabo Delgado. Mondlane
stated in a live-stream that the election results of 71% for Chapo were
"totally absurd" and that "The revolution has arrived... The time has
come."[40] During these riots Mozambican security forces killed at least 11
protesters and used live ammunition and tear gas to clear crowds which was met
with heavy criticism from Human Rights Watch. Additionally, another 50 where
injured and over 400 protesters were arrested in a two day period from 24 to
25 October.[41]

On 27 October PODEMOS formally filed an appeal with the Constitutional Council
against the results.[42][43]

On 28 October Mondlane called for the formation of a rival "Government of
National Unity" consisting of all opposition parties to form a united front
against FRELIMO.[44] All opposition parties except RENAMO joined this
coalition, including New Democracy and MDM.[45]

Incumbent President Filipe Nyusi urging residents to stay home amid
protests.[46] On 29 October Mondlane called for a week-long strike, and for a
4-million strong march on Maputo on 7 November to overwhelm Mozambican
authorities with the sheer size of a protest.[47] The 7 November protests also
led to clashes with police. Mondlane also fled Mozambique and said that he was
not in Africa.[48]

On 31 October RENAMO announced that they where preparing to release their
parallel vote count, stating they had won the popular vote in two
provinces.[49] Its leader Ossufo Momade, also accused FRELIMO of fraud and
claimed to have won the election.[50] Additionally, Amnesty International
called on Mozambican authorities to stop using deadly force on protesters.[51]
It also accused the government of blocking access to internet and media
websites. On 5 November, defence minister Cristóvão Chume called the protests
an attempt to overthrow the government and deployed the army to restore order.
The South African government closed the Lebombo border crossing with
Mozambique following violent protests and barricades on the Mozambican
side.[52][53] Fifteen officials from the Mozambican border post fled to South
Africa seeking shelter from the violence.[54]
