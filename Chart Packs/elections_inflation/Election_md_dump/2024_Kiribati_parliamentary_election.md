Parliamentary elections were held in Kiribati in 2024 to elect members of the
Maneaba ni Maungatabu, with the first round held on 14 August and the second
on 19 August.[1]

## Electoral system

[edit]

Of the 45 members of the Maneaba ni Maungatabu, 44 are elected in 23 single
and multi-member electoral districts (seven with one seat, eleven with two
seats, and five with three seats) using a modified two-round system.[2] The
45th member of the legislature is nominated by the Banaban community resident
on Rabi Island in Fiji.[3]

A voter has as many votes to cast as the number of seats in their electoral
district. In the first round, a candidate is elected if they receive more than
50% of the ballots cast.[2] When not all seats are filled, a second round is
held with the number of candidates being equal to the number of seats
remaining to be filled plus two, with those who received the fewest votes in
the first round being eliminated. In the second round, voters have as many
votes to cast as there are vacancies remaining. The top candidates are elected
even if they do not receive a majority. A tie in the second round results in a
third round of voting.[4]

For the 2024 election, there are nearly 53,000 registered voters.[5]

## Issues

[edit]

Among issues prominent during the election were inflation, rising sea levels,
public spending, the national debt, and relations with China.[6][7] In 2019
Kiribati President Taneti Maamau ended the nation's longstanding diplomatic
recognition of Taiwan, instead recognizing the People's Republic of China.
This caused a rift within his own government which resulted in the fiercely
fought election in 2020. This switch has strained relations between Kiribati
and various Pacific nations, as well as Australia, Kiribati's long-time
traditional trade partner. This was coupled with Maamau withdrawing Kiribati
from the Pacific Islands Forum claiming that the organization was no longer
serving Kiribati's interests. Senior opposition figure Banuera Berina, who
split from Maamau's Tobwaan Kiribati Party (TKP) due to the Chinese issue,
called the nation's relationship with the PRC as "not healthy for the
country". Additionally, Rimon Rimon, a local investigative journalist,
described the island nation as "a landscape of fear" as Maamau and the TKP
have created a political system dominated by personal patronage over party
affiliation, where those with close ties to the government find it far easier
to win elections due to being allocated government resources.[8]

The Maamau-led government has partnered with the PRC on a series of
infrastructure projects to boost the island's fishing and tourism industries,
as well as letting the PRC rebuild a World War II-era American airbase on
Kanton, roughly halfway between Hawaii and Fiji. In 2021 Maamau abolished the
Phoenix Islands Protected Area, opening the area up for more PRC fishing
vessels. Opposition candidates have also accused the TKP of being financially
backed by the PRC, claiming that the PRC is funneling money into political
coffers to prevent a change in the nation's leadership. In an effort to weaken
the opposition, in August 2022 Maamau sought to deport High Court justice
David Lambourne, husband of Leader of the Opposition Tessie Eria Lambourne.
This move was initially blocked by Kiribati’s Court of Appeal. By September
2022 Maamau's attacks on the Judiciary had resulted in the suspension of Chief
Justice William Hastings and all Court of Appeal judges, in a move that has
been labeled as democratic backsliding and as autocratic.[8]

## Results

A total of 114 people ran in the election, of which 18 were women.[9] Out of
the 44 seats to be contested, four candidates were declared elected unopposed
at the close of nominations on 24 July 2024 - Tinian Reiher and Alexander
Teabo from Butaritari, Bootii Nauan from South Tabiteuea and Tekeeua Tarati
from Tamana.[9] All four were incumbents, with three (Alexander, Bootii and
Tekeeua) being Ministers in the outgoing TKP government.

### First round

[edit]

By 16 August, the full results for the first round were released, with the
outcomes broadcast locally and online by Radio Kiribati. Of the 44 seats, 25
seats were decided and 19 seats (across 12 electoral districts) will require a
second round on 19 August. President Taneti Maamau comfortably retained his
seat in Onotoa. Six members lost their seats, including Minister for
Infrastructure and Sustainable Energy, Willie Tokataake in Abemama. Three
women were elected, including Leader of the Opposition in the last Parliament,
Tessie Eria Lambourne, in Abemama.[10] Seven women will contest the second
round in five electoral districts (Arorae, Betio, Fanning (Tabuaeran), North
Tabiteuea and Tarawa Teinainano). If voting trends from the first round
continue through to the second round, Kiribati could have as many as seven
women in the new Parliament, which would be a record number. Late on 15 August
the Ministry of Culture and Internal Affairs (under which the Electoral
Commission sits) published official results for the first round elections in
all but the Tarawa Teinainano electoral district.[11] On 17 August the Office
of the President published a full list of the results on its official Facebook
page.[12]

### Second round

[edit]

Voting commenced at 7:00am and continued until 6:00pm.[13] All results had
been declared by 1:30pm in Tarawa on 20 August. Eight more members lost their
seats, including Minister for Culture and Internal Affairs, Boutu Bateriki in
Rural Tarawa, and Minister for Labour and Human Resources Development, Taabeta
Amuera Teakai in Tarawa Teinainano. Also unseated was former Vice-President
Teima Onorio, who had represented Arorae since 1998. The Speaker of the
outgoing Parliament, Tangariki Reete, regained her seat in Betio. 'Father of
the House', Ieremia Tabai, was elected to serve his 12th term as one of the
two members from Nonouti. For the first time the Parliament will have a
husband and wife as members, with Lavinia Teatao Teem from Abaiang and Jacob
Teem representing Kiritimati. On 20 August the Ministry of Culture and
Internal Affairs published a full list of the results on its official Facebook
page.[14]

In summary, 27 members retained their seats. Sixteen members were elected to
Parliament for the first time, including three female members. Tangariki Reete
returns to Parliament after losing her Betio seat in 2020.[15] A total of five
women were elected to the new Parliament, a record for Kiribati. Fourteen
members of the outgoing Parliament lost their seats, including three TKP
Ministers.[16] With nearly 53,000 registered voters, the first round saw an
overall turn-out of 87.14%. The turn-out for the second round was
83.52%.[_citation needed_]

The new Parliament will sit for the first time on 13 September 2024.[17] After
being sworn in, members will elect a new Speaker and determine the candidates
for the presidential election. The presidential election is likely to take
place in mid-October.

## Aftermath

[edit]

On 22 August, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration announced that
all scheduled diplomatic visits to the country were to be suspended or
cancelled until 2025, citing concerns over their effect on the formation of a
new government after the election and inability to accommodate visitors while
the process was ongoing.[19]

With the ruling Tobwaan Kiribati Party having won 33 of 45 seats, it was able
to block the nomination of opposition candidates for president. The TKP
nominated incumbent president Taneti Maamau, alongside others described as
"dummy candidates." Maamau is expected to retain his position.[20] Opposition
leader Tessie Lambourne decried the move, saying "Kiribati is now a one-party
state."[21] The presidential election is scheduled for 25 October.[22]
