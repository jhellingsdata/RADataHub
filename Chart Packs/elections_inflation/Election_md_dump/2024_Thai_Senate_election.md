Senate elections were held in Thailand from 9 to 26 June 2024, the first of
its kind under the 2017 Constitution. Under the Constitution, the transitional
Senate of Thailand expired on 10 May 2024. Afterwards, the following Senates
will be a 200-member body and have no power to elect Prime Ministers.

This was the first election to utilize the highly complex electoral system
envisioned by the 2018 Organic Act on the Acquisition of Senators. Its members
will be elected among the independent candidates, without participation from
outside the candidate pool. The elections were already criticized for the
complexity, secrecy and confusion of the voting system.

## Background

[edit]

The Thai Senate has undergone several reformations since it was originally
established in 1947. On various occasions, the Senate has been appointed,
directly elected, indirectly elected, or some combination of these. Under the
present 2017 Constitution, which was promulgated in the aftermath of the 2014
Thai coup d'état, provided for a 5-year transitional Senate appointed by the
National Council for Peace and Order, the military junta that governed
Thailand from the coup in 2014 until 2019, followed by "permanent" Senates.

The transitional Senate is composed of 250 members handpicked by the junta. It
had the power to vote for Prime Minister, alongside members of the House of
Representatives. It voted overwhelmingly for Prayut Chan-o-cha in 2019 and
Srettha Thavisin in 2023. This provision came under intense public scrutiny
during the 2023 Prime Ministerial election, when Senators refused to back the
election of Pita Limjaroenrat, despite a large majority of the House
supporting his candidacy.[1]

After the transitional Senate expires on 10 May 2024, the following Senates
are indirectly elected via a highly complex election system, intended to
produce a technocratic institution. The 2024 elections will be the first to
use this system. The permanent Senate will not have the power to vote for
Prime Minister.

### 2023 elections

[edit]

Main article: 2023 Thai general election

The government of Prayut Chan-o-cha was defeated in a landslide in the 2023
House of Representatives elections.[2][3] The Move Forward Party won the most
seats, with Pheu Thai Party in second place. An attempt to form a coalition
government between the two parties failed, after Move Forward leader Pita
Limjaroenrat failed to be elected prime minister, largely because of
opposition from the conservative Senate.[4]

Instead, the government was formed by Pheu Thai's Srettha Thavisin.[5] The
Srettha Cabinet is supported by the conservative Bhumjaithai Party and Chart
Thai Pattana Party, as well as Prayut-aligned parties such as Palang
Pracharath Party and United Thai Nation Party.

## Electoral system

[edit]

The permanent Senate of Thailand is composed of 200 senators, chosen by and
among "persons having the knowledge, expertise, experience, profession, or
characteristics or common interests or working or having worked in varied
areas of the society".[6] It is a non-partisan body, and all candidates will
run as independents. Senators serve five-year terms and are ineligible for re-
election thereafter. The rules for the election are laid down in the 2018
Organic Act on the Acquisition of Senators.[7]

Candidates must be Thai nationals by birth, at least 40 years old, and have a
minimum of 10 years experience in their field. The 20 groups include:

  1. Public administration and national security group
  2. Law and justice group
  3. Education group
  4. Public health group
  5. Rice or emblements farmer group
  6. Orchardists, persons who work in forests, ranch, and fishing group
  7. Employees excluding governmental employees group
  8. Persons who work in the environmental, city planning, real estate and utilities, natural resource, and energy field group
  9. SME entrepreneurs and other group
  10. Entrepreneurs other than (9) group
  11. Persons who work in the tourism field group
  12. Industrialists and similar group
  13. Persons who work in the scientific, technological, communications, innovative, or similar field group
  14. Women group
  15. Elderly, disabled, ethnic minority and other identity groups
  16. Arts, culture, music, performance and entertainment group
  17. NGOs group
  18. Persons in sports, mass media and literature group
  19. Freelancer group
  20. Other group

They must have some connection to the district they seek to contest in. They
must also pay a 2,500 baht application fee. Candidates cannot be members of a
political party. Also prohibited from contesting are civil servants, current
and former member of parliaments, former government ministers, former local
administrators, former political party executives (unless they have been out
of their post for at least five years), parents, spouses and children of
senatorial candidates. Members of the transitional Senate cannot run.

Senators are elected among applicant candidates pool, without any
participation from non-candidates. Each candidate applies to represent one of
20 eligible groups, and ten senators will be elected from each group. There
are six rounds of voting, two each at the district, provincial, and national
level. Notably, the public cannot observe the voting process, except the
candidates themselves.

### Timeline

[edit]

At the district level, the candidates will vote within their group. In each
district, the five candidates in each group with the most votes will advance
to the second round. In the second round, each candidate will be assigned 3–5
random groups (other than their own), and vote for the candidates in those
groups. The top three candidates in each group in each district will then
advance, for a total of 60 candidates in each district.

The provincial level process will occur on 16 June. Because the number of
districts in each province varies (anywhere between three and 50), the number
of candidates in each province will vary significantly. Candidates will first
narrow the number of candidates in their group to 5. They will then again vote
for candidates in other groups. They may or may not be assigned the same
groups to vote in at the provincial level than at the district level. There
will now be 2 candidates in each group in each province, for a total of 3,080
remaining candidates nationwide.

The process will then move on to the national level, where the remaining 3,080
candidates will repeat the intra and inter-group voting to elect 10 senators
from each of the 20 groups.

The number of candidates each voter is allowed to vote for varies depending on
the round. The system lends itself to limited voting. At the district and
provincial level, each voter will have two votes within their group, and one
vote for the inter-group election. At the national level, a voter may have ten
votes for the intra-group election, and five for the inter-group election. The
candidates with the most votes will proceed, and all others will be
eliminated. There is no minimum threshold of votes required to be elected.
Candidates may vote for themselves in the intra-group elections. A voter may
not cast more than one vote for a single candidate. A voter does not need to
use all of their votes.

Summary of election process[8] Round | Date | Level | Candidates progressing | Election rules   
---|---|---|---|---  
In group | All groups | Across Thailand   
1 | 9 June | In each of the 928 districts | 5 | 100 | 92,800 | Limited voting (2 votes)   
2 | 3 | 60 | 55,680 | Single non-transferable vote (SNTV)   
3 | 16 June | In each of the 77 provinces | 5 | 100 | 7,700 | Limited voting (2 votes)   
4 | 2 | 40 | 3,080 | Single non-transferable vote (SNTV)   
5 | 26 June | Across Thailand | 40 | 800 | Limited voting (10 votes)   
6 | 10 | 200 | Limited voting (5 votes)   
  
## Criticism

[edit]

The electoral system is controversial. Critics have referred to it as "the
most complicated election in the world".[9]

Other criticism centers on the system's alleged vulnerability to manipulation.
Because any eligible person can run, district-level elections can be packed in
order to ensure the election of particular candidates. The 2018 election for
the transitional Senate utilized a similar system, although most senators were
ultimately selected by the junta. Candidates who participated in the process
alleged vote buying, saying that desired candidates utilized their
professional connections to be elected.

## Results

[edit]

The Election Commission published the list of elected senators in the Royal
Gazette and subsequently inaugurated them on 10 July.[10]

Blue Senators (153)

New Breed Senators (19)

Unafilliated/Unknown (28)

On 23 July 2024, the newly elected Senators gathered to elect the President.
The results were 153 for the so-called "Blue Senators," who were alleged to be
affiliated with Bhumjaithai Party, 19 for the so-called "New Breed Senators"
who vowed to promote liberal and progressive causes (despite 30 pledged into
this camp beforehand), and 13 for the unaffiliated of the two aforementioned
camps. This included invalid and blank votes.[12]
