Parliamentary elections were held in Madagascar on 29 May 2024 to elect the
163 members of the National Assembly. The election took place a few months
after Andry Rajoelina was re-elected in the  November 2023 presidential
elections, which were marked by low turnout and an opposition boycott.[1]

The ruling Young Malagasies Determined remained the largest party in the
National Assembly and maintained its overall majority. The opposition
coalition Firaisankina [fr], led by Marc Ravalomanana, gained 22 seats, an
increase of 6 seats compared to the previous election. Smaller parties such as
FIVOI and Kôlektifa also secured seats, while independent candidates made a
strong showing, winning 50 seats.

## Electoral system

[edit]

The 163 members of the National Assembly[2] are elected via a parallel voting
system:[3] 77 seats are elected in single-member constituencies by first-past-
the-post voting, while the remaining 86 seats are elected in 43 multi-member
constituencies (of two seats each) by closed list proportional representation
using the highest averages method.

For this election, 12 million people are eligible to vote.[4] More than 450
candidates contested the election.[5]

## Campaign issues

[edit]

Issues in the campaign included corruption, infrastructure and the economy.[6]

## Conduct

[edit]

Voting was held from 06:00 to 17:00 on 29 May. Observers from the African
Union and the Southern African Development Community monitored the
proceedings.[5] The election was overseen by the Independent National
Electoral Commission (CENI).[7] There was increased security.[8] On 1 June,
the Safidy Observatory, the country's largest election monitoring group,
raised doubts on the neutrality, impartiality and independence of CENI in its
conduct of the vote.[9] The release of the provisional results by CENI was
initially scheduled to take place on 8 June, but was postponed to 11 June.[10]

## Results

[edit]

On 11 June, CENI published the provisional results showing no clear majority.
The pro-regime coalition IRMAR (Isika Rehetra Miaraka amin'ny Andry Rajoelina,
All together with Andry Rajoelina) lost its majority and won 80 seats, while
independents and the opposition party Firaisankina [fr] won 55 and 22 seats
respectively. Other small parties such as FIVOI received four seats while the
Kolektifan'ny Malagasy and Antoko Maitso hasin'i Madagasikara received one
seat each. Turnout was estimated at 47%.[11] Results from 122 polling stations
were not included because fires destroyed voting materials on 31 May.[12]

The final results were announced by the High Constitutional Court on 28
June.[2]

## Reactions

[edit]

Opposition leader and former president Marc Ravalomanana accused Tanora
Malagasy Vonona, the ruling party of his successor, Andry Rajoelina, of
violations and fraud.[11]
