Early parliamentary elections were held in Bulgaria on 9 June 2024,[2][3] to
elect members of the National Assembly.[4] The election coincided with the
European Parliament election on the same day.[2][3]

This parliamentary election was initially scheduled to be held before 12 June
2027; however, the planned rotation agreed to by GERB and PP–DB failed to
materialise in March 2024, and no other government could be formed.

GERB–SDS had the best results, winning nearly 24% of the vote and 68 seats,
but it did not obtain a majority in the National Assembly.[5] Voter turnout
was 33%, which was the lowest turnout since the end of communist rule in
1989.[6]

The new elected 50th Parliament replaced the 49th Parliament,[7] when all
elected members were sworn in on 19 June 2024.[8] The final of three
government formation attempts failed on 5 August 2024.[9][10][11] On 9 August,
the Bulgarian President as a consequence instead appointed Goritsa
Grancharova-Kozhareva (Vice President of the Bulgarian National Audit Office)
as the next caretaker prime minister.[12] Grancharova-Kozhareva was granted
ten days to form a proposal for the next caretaker government to be appointed
on 20 August 2024, and the upcoming next parliamentary elections were
scheduled for 20 October 2024.[13]

## Background

[edit]

See also: 2021–present Bulgarian political crisis and 2023 Bulgarian
parliamentary election

Following several snap elections, the Bulgarian National Assembly had failed
to put together a long-lasting government since 'anti-corruption' parties made
a breakthrough in the April 2021 election.[6][4] The 2023 election saw little
change from 2022, with Boyko Borisov's centre-right GERB–SDS narrowly coming
in first place, above the centrist PP–DB alliance. The far right Revival (VAZ)
and the populist There is Such a People (ITN) made gains, with the latter re-
entering the Assembly after it failed to reach the electoral threshold in
2022.[14][15]

On 22 May 2023, the PP- and GERB-led alliances agreed to form a government
with a rotational premiership. Nikolai Denkov, PP's candidate, would be the
Prime Minister for the first nine months of the government and Mariya Gabriel,
the GERB candidate, would serve as deputy prime minister and foreign affairs
minister. After nine months, the two would switch positions.[16]

Denkov resigned in accordance with the rotation agreement on 5 March, to allow
Gabriel to become the new Prime Minister.[17] On 20 March 2024, the planned
government rotation and signing of a renewed government failed due to
disagreements between the two alliances on the cabinet and breaking down of
relations.[18][19][20] Negotiations ensued across to form a new
government,[21] but failed to produce any governments that could reach a
majority support.[22][23][24][25] GERB rejected the chance to form a
government. PP–DB made a limited attempt to respect the original rotation
agreement. The final chance to form a government, chosen by president Rumen
Radev, went to ITN, which was immediately rejected.[26][27][28][29]

On 29 March, as per Article 98 of the constitution,[30] the President
appointed the Chairman of the National Audit Office, Dimitar Glavchev, as the
candidate for caretaker prime minister.[31] He was granted a one week deadline
of until 6 April to propose the composition of the caretaker government.[32]

Glavchev presented his proposal for the caretaker government on 5 April,[33]
accepted by the President following negotiations and scheduling the election
for 9 June.[34][35] Glavchev and his cabinet were inaugurated on 9 April by
the National Assembly.[36]

### Election schedule

[edit]

The Central Election Commission announced the campaign would begin at midday
on 10 May and end at midnight on 7 June.[37]

The current 49th Parliament was to stay in session at least until the election
campaign begins, where a decision of election recess is expected to be adopted
by Parliament. The 49th Parliament suspended its normal working process by an
adopted election recess on 27 April. While on election recess the 49th
Parliament could reconvene for an extraordinary sitting in exceptional
circumstances. The 50th Parliament will replace the 49th Parliament as soon as
the newly elected members are sworn in after the election.[38]

On election day, polling opened at 07:00 and closed at 20:00.[39]

### Allegations of corruption and improper political behaviour

[edit]

#### Customs Agency scandal

[edit]

On 3 April, the head of the Customs Agency, Petya Bankova, along with her
deputy, and two others were arrested in relation to their alleged
participation in an organised criminal group dealing blackmarket tobacco
products.[41] Following the arrests, Secretary of the Ministry of Interior
Zhivko Kotsev announced his resignation, with PP–DB leaders suggesting this
had been coerced.[42] A day later, Kotsev withdrew his resignation in a joint-
briefing with acting Prime Minister Nikolay Denkov where they repeated the
claim.[43]

Photos including the suspects and PP–DB-affiliated politicians were leaked,
and Parliament formed a commission to investigate the scandal.
Controversially, one of its aims was to investigate the role of PP co-leader
Asen Vasilev in the affair.[44][45] The commission heard claims that the PP–DB
politicians were involved.[46] These claims were disputed, and former PP
interior minister Boyko Rashkov claimed those alleging the link were
themselves involved in the scandal.[47] Vasilev also appeared before the
committee, denying any wrong doing or connections with the named suspects.[48]

On 25 April, the committee published its report, which claimed to prove Asen
Vasilev's role within the scheme.[49]

The events of the scandal, despite occurring outside the election campaign
period, were identified by some analysts as signalling the "beginning" of the
pre-election campaign.[50] Additionally, the scandal was used in the campaign,
notably by ITN, in order to attack PP–DB.[51]

#### "Turkish Stream" gas pipeline scandal

[edit]

In early March, an alleged copy of the roadmap for the construction of the
TurkStream (also known as the "Balkan Stream") gas pipeline through Bulgaria
was released by the investigative newspaper, BG Elves.[52] It suggested that
the main role in the construction of the pipeline was undertaken by Russian
firms, additionally it demonstrated that the pipeline's construction directly
served Russian interests.[53] The pipeline was given approval by the Third
Borisov government.

PP–DB accused GERB of helping Russia build a new pathway for natural gas
circumventing Ukraine, thus enabling the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[54] A
parliamentary committee was formed to investigate the leak, however, its work
ended up being hindered due to partisan gridlock.[55]

#### Audio-tape leaks

[edit]

As had occurred previously during the government formation of the Denkov
Government, audio recordings by senior PP–DB figures were allegedly leaked.
One, published on the online newspaper Afera, was from a PP leadership meeting
where they discussed illegal party finance methods.[56] PP–DB representatives
claimed this recording was taken out of context.[57]

#### Borisov–Peevski billboard

[edit]

As part of their campaign, PP–DB released a billboard containing the image of
former Prime Minister Denkov, on one side, and the leaders of GERB and DPS,
Borisov and Peevski, on the other, with a sign asking "who do you want to be
prime minister?". The sign was promptly removed after a legal complaint by
GERB, who claimed the billboard denigrated the person of Boyko Borisov.[58] In
a campaign meeting, Borisov called Denkov's behaviour as offensive, and
claimed that this demonstrated that Denkov was unfit to be prime minister.[59]

### Public finances

[edit]

During the election campaign, GERB, specifically Delyan Dobrev consistently
criticised the policies of Asen Vasilev, accusing him of increasing the public
debt and increasing inflation, while not doing enough to attract
investment.[60] Borisov declared that if GERB were to come to power they would
implement a more "strict" fiscal policy.[61]

PP–DB, on the other hand, defended the track record of Asen Vasilev, pointing
to an increase in incomes.[62] They further accused GERB of trying to add
spending outside of that set aside by the budget in order to sabotage
Bulgaria's entrance into the Eurozone.[63]

Parties on the left, such as BSP, Levitsata and Solidary Bulgaria, generally
supported the implementation of a progressive tax system, with BSP, for
example, advocating for a tax break for all those under 26.[64]

The right-wing coalition, Blue Bulgaria, called for less state involvement in
the economy, with government finance instead being focused on healthcare,
education and security.[65]

### Foreign policy

[edit]

One of the key policy issues which dominated the elections was Bulgaria's
position on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A number of parties
(specifically, Revival, BSP, Levitsata!, Solidary Bulgaria and Velichie)
advocated for Bulgaria to not send lethal aid to Ukraine and supported paying
Russia for gas.[66][67]

### Post-election government formation

[edit]

Due to the continuous political instability in Bulgaria, ever since the April
2021 Bulgarian parliamentary election, post-election government formations has
been one of the key topics of the election campaign.

GERB, shortly after the collapse of government negotiations following the
Denkov government's resignation, had indicated that they would re-initiate
negotiations with PP–DB, albeit conditional on a "new approach" from the PP–DB
leadership.[68] However, they became more hostile to PP–DB, especially after
they supported a motion to oust the GERB speaker of the National Assembly.[69]
Boyko Borisov, GERB's leader, made clear that they would not govern solely
with DPS.[70] On 24 May, Borisov announced that GERB should take a "leading
role" in any future government.[71]

PP–DB expressed a willingness to negotiate a coalition government with GERB,
however it excluded the possibility of any involvement from Delyan Peevski in
a future government, thus excluding DPS.[72] During an interview with bTV,
former Prime Minister Nikolay Denkov stated that PP–DB would not form a
government which involved either Boyko Borisov or Delyan Peevski.[73]

Delyan Peevski, on his part, did not exclude his party's participation in
either a GERB-led or PP–DB-led government, claiming he had a stable working
relationship with both PP leader Kiril Petkov and Boyko Borisov.[74]

A number of parties promised during the campaign period promised they would
not enter any informal governing arrangements with GERB, DPS or PP–DB.
Specifically, BSP leader, Korneliya Ninova, highlighted her party as the "only
one" which had not engaged in any such deals with GERB.[75] Solidary Bulgaria
candidate, and Stand Up.BG leader, Maya Manolova promised that Solidary, if
they entered parliament, would not govern with GERB, DPS or PP–DB.[76]

## Aftermath

[edit]

GERB–SDS leader Boyko Borisov thanked voters for the party's performance in
the election.[77] Kiril Petkov conceded and announced PP–DB would form a
constructive opposition to the government once it is formed.[78]

Both Korneliya Ninova, the leader of the BSP, and Hristo Ivanov, leader of
DaB!, resigned following the results.[79]

The new elected 50th Parliament replaced the 49th Parliament,[7] when all
elected members were sworn in on 19 June 2024.[8]

### Coalition negotiations

[edit]

The leader of the DPS, Delyan Peevski, called for discussions between all
"Euro-Atlantic" parties.[79]

GERB said that they were seeking to form an "expert" government and dominate
key ministries, including the office of Prime Minister. However, Borisov
announced that he did not want the position.[80][81] The BSP leadership
suggested they could support an expert cabinet.[79]

The Bulgarian newspaper _Dnevnik_ set out the following scenarios:[82]

Coalition  | Projected seats  | Status in the National Assembly  | Notes   
---|---|---|---  
GERB+DPS  |  68+47   
  
  
| Minority (115 of 240)  |   
GERB+DPS+ITN  |  68+47+16   
  
  
| Majority (131 of 240)  |   
GERB+BSP+ITN  |  68+19+16   
  
  
| Minority (103 of 240)  | All parties support an "expert cabinet"   
Caretaker government  | _N/A_ | _N/A_ | New elections in Autumn   
  
The caretaker government in place ahead of the election, will continue as
caretaker government after the election, until the point of time it can be
replaced by a new government. As regulated by the Bulgarian Constitution, the
first negotiation mandate to try form a new government will automatically be
given to the largest elected party (GERB–SDS), and if this attempt fails the
second negotiation mandate to try form a new government will then
automatically be given to the second largest elected party (DPS). If no
government can be formed within the first or the second mandate, then the
Bulgarian President will give a third mandate to an elected parliamentary
party at his discretion. If the third mandate also fails to form a government,
then a caretaker government will be appointed by the President and new snap
parliamentary elections shall be scheduled within two months after its
inauguration.[83]

#### First negotiation mandate

[edit]

On 17 June GERB began the negotiations with other parties within the first
negotiation mandate, inviting all to discussions over the following two
days.[84][85] The framework for the first negotiation mandate, was the
GERB–SDS proposal to form an expert cabinet on their mandate; and with
GERB–SDS representatives occupying the positions of prime minister (although
not being their party leader Boyko Borisov), foreign minister, and defence
minister.[86] PP–DB, BSPzB and VAZ refused to attend the negotiations, so
there was only a meeting between GERB and DPS on the first day;[87] both
parties suggested they would be ready to form a government in coalition.[88]
On the second day, only ITN joined the talks, but only to declare they would
neither back a government formed within the first nor the second negotiation
mandate (led by GERB–SDS or DPS).[83] ITN clarified they would under no
circumstances support the formation of a GERB-DPS government or a GERB-DPS-ITN
government; meaning that ITN would only support the formation of a politically
neutral expert cabinet within the third negotiation mandate (preferably backed
by all parties), and hoped to be selected as the party in charge of the third
negotiation mandate to form such a government.[89]

On 20 June GERB, DPS and ITN all supported the GERB candidate for the Speaker
of the National Assembly, Raya Nazaryan. One VAZ member also voted for her,
but the rest of the party abstained. Borisov had declared that there would be
new elections if she failed to be elected.[90][91][92]

There were also reports that 5 or 6 of the Velichie deputies could split off
to support a GERB-DPS government, which could give it a narrow majority.[93]

On 24 June President Rumen Radev started the consultations about the next
steps in the government formation process, with all Parliamentary Groups
invited for meetings in the order of their elected size.[94] GERB–SDS, DPS,
PP–DB were consulted on 24 June; VAZ and BSPzB were consulted on 25 June;
while ITN and Velichie were consulted on 26 June.[95] PP–DB confirmed their
initial stance, that they in no circumstances would be part of nor support a
GERB/DPS government; but thought GERB/DPS now should be granted time by Radev
to investigate if it was possible to form a government with other
parliamentary parties under a first or second negotiation mandate – and in the
event of formation of such a government then PP–DB would play the role of
being a constructive opposition party. PP–DB remained silent on how they would
position themselves in case a potential third negotiation mandate should be
needed during the attempts to form a government, "because it would be wrong
[speaking about a third mandate], considering that the first two mandates are
still coming up" and as of now "everything possible should be done to fulfill
the first or second mandate".[96]

On 1 July President Radev formally asked GERB-SDS to form a minority
government with former National Assembly speaker Rosen Zhelyazkov as prime-
minister designate.[97] The minority government proposed by Zhelyazkov was
largely composed of ministers from previous GERB governments, while also
including several incumbent Caretaker Ministers. After the first mandate was
received by Zhelyazkov, Boyko Borisov stated that if the government was
approved without clear political support, it would only undertake urgent
priority tasks before resigning.[98] On 3 July, the National Assembly voted
138–98 to reject the proposed government.[99]

#### Second negotiation mandate

[edit]

The second cabinet-forming negotiation mandate was as a consequence instead
granted to the second-largest PP–DB on 22 July, but only to be returned
immediately as an unsuccessful attempt.[101]

#### Third negotiation mandate

[edit]

President Radev granted the third and final negotiation mandate to ITN on 29
July, who attempted to form a neutral, Euro-Atlantic, expert government.[102]

ITN had the support of 66 MPs, including its own, independents formerly
aligned with Velichie and DPS, as well as BSP.[103][104][105] PP–DB also
considered supporting the proposal.[106]

The mandate was unsuccessfully returned on 5 August,[10][11] which paved the
way for Radev to appoint a caretaker government and schedule new snap
parliamentary elections within two months after its inauguration.[107][108]

### Changes in the Assembly's composition

[edit]

One MP was expelled from the BSP by its national council on 18 June, before
being sworn in.[109]

The Velichie parliamentary group comprised 13 MPs after the election. On 5
July, six MPs broke away from the group, dissolving it.[110]

A rift in DPS surrounding Delyan Peevski saw 17 MPs expelled and a further
eight leave.[111]

### Caretaker government

[edit]

In order to appoint a caretaker government, President Radev had to find a
candidate for Prime Minister. Initially, the GERB speaker of the Assembly,
Raya Nazaryan, was reported as being an option, but she declared she did not
wish to be a candidate.[112] The incumbent caretaker prime minister, Dimitar
Glavchev, however confirmed that he was ready to stay in office if President
Radev offered to reappoint him for a second term.[113] Radev held
consultations on forming an interim government with all parliamentary groups
on 8 August.[114]

On 9 August Radev appointed Goritsa Grancharova-Kozhareva, Vice President of
the Bulgarian National Audit Office, as the next caretaker prime minister.[12]
Grancharova-Kozhareva was granted ten days to form a proposal for the next
caretaker government to be appointed on 20 August 2024, which would put the
date of the next election as 20 October 2024.[13] On 19 August, Radev refused
to appoint the government, as he opposed the proposal to allow the
controversial figure Kalin Stoyanov to continue as interior
minister.[115][116] As such, the Glavchev government is continuing its duties
and the election is postponed until a caretaker government is approved.[116]
This has been reported to be a potential constitutional crisis, with some
scholars arguing Radev does not have the power to refuse the appointment of a
caretaker government.[117][118][119]
