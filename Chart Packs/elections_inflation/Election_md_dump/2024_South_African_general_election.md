General elections were held in South Africa on 29 May 2024 to elect a new
National Assembly as well as the provincial legislature in each of the nine
provinces.[1][2] This was the 7th general election held under the conditions
of universal adult suffrage since the end of the apartheid era in 1994. The
new National Council of Provinces (NCOP) will be elected at the first sitting
of each provincial legislature.

Support for the ruling African National Congress (ANC) significantly declined
in this election; the ANC remained the largest party but lost the
parliamentary majority that it had held since the inaugural post-apartheid
election in 1994. The centrist Democratic Alliance (DA) remained in second
place with a slight increase. uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), a left-wing populist
party founded 6 months prior to the election and led by former president Jacob
Zuma, came in third place.[3]

On 14 June 2024, the ANC, the DA, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the
Patriotic Alliance (PA), agreed to form a national unity government, with
Cyril Ramaphosa being re-elected President of South Africa.[4][5]

## Background

[edit]

The election date of 29 May 2024 was declared by the incumbent president Cyril
Ramaphosa on 20 February.[6][7]

Going into the election, polls showed that support for the ANC was declining
significantly, leading to expectations of a hung parliament.[8] In the 2021
South African municipal elections, the African National Congress received less
than 50% of the total vote for the first time since the end of apartheid,[9]
also losing support in the key metros of Tshwane (Pretoria), Johannesburg,
Ekurhuleni, and eThekwini (Durban). The ANC retained control of eThekwini
while the Democratic Alliance managed to take control of Johannesburg and
Ekurhuleni through a majority coalition and a minority coalition respectively,
in addition to forming a majority coalition government in Tshwane, which it
had governed since 2016.[10]

In early 2023, the ANC and Economic Freedom Fighters formed a coalition in
Johannesburg and Ekurhuleni where the two parties held MMC positions whilst
electing a mayor from a minority party.[11] In April 2023, noting the
prospects of an ANC/EFF national coalition, the DA leader John Steenhuisen
called for "like-minded" parties to join to prevent a "doomsday
coalition".[12]

### uMkhonto we Sizwe

[edit]

On 16 December 2023, former president Jacob Zuma announced his departure from
the ANC, accusing the party and incumbent president Cyril Ramaphosa of serving
as a "proxy for white monopoly capital." He was also noted as calling the ANC
"sellouts" and "apartheid collaborators" He also announced establishment of
his own political party, uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), named after the apartheid-era
military wing of the ANC.[13] The latter filed a lawsuit against the MK's
registration in the Electoral Commission of South Africa, which was dismissed
by the Electoral Court of South Africa on 26 March 2024 due to lack of merit.
The ANC also plans to file a lawsuit against the party's naming after the
historic MK.[14] According to opinion polling, it was suggested that MK could
become the kingmakers after the elections.[15]

On 28 March 2024, the Electoral Commission barred Zuma from standing in the
election, citing a previous criminal conviction.[16] MK appealed the
ruling,[17] with Zuma's lawyers arguing that the conviction was of a civil
nature, and the decision was overturned by the Electoral Court on 9 April,[18]
permitting Zuma to stand.[19] On 12 April, the Electoral Commission announced
that it would approach the Constitutional Court for clarity on section
47(1)(e) of the constitution, the provision used to uphold the initial
objection against Zuma.[20] On 30 April, police launched an investigation into
whether the MK had forged signatures in order to be able to register for the
election.[21] On 20 May, Zuma was ruled ineligible to stand for the election
by the Constitutional Court, citing his criminal conviction.[22] He was still
allowed to campaign for MK[23] and his name was retained on the ballot as
party leader.[24]

### Multi-Party Charter

[edit]

A pre-election agreement called the Multi-Party Charter was signed between the
Democratic Alliance (DA), Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), Freedom Front Plus (FF
Plus), ActionSA and three other parties with the aim of presenting a united
front against the three-decade rule of the African National Congress (ANC)
party and the rise of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), uMkhonto we Sizwe
(MK Party) and the Patriotic Alliance (PA).[25][26][27] The Spectrum National
Party, Ekhethu People's Party and Unemployed National Party[28] joined the MPC
but failed to meet the Independent Electoral Commission's minimum number of
signatures required to contest seats in the National Assembly.[29] On 7
October 2023, the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) joined the
charter. Going into the election, the MPC members represented 112 of the 400
seats in the National Assembly.[30] During the 2024 election, the parties in
the charter collectively won 119 of the 400 seats in the National Assembly,
increasing the number of seats by seven. On 6 June 2024, ActionSA announced
that they would leave the Multi-Party Charter. This decision reduced the
charter's seat count from 119 to 113 in the 400-seat National
Assembly.[31][32]

### Voter turnout

[edit]

Voter turnout has been decreasing since the end of apartheid, when 86% of
eligible voters turned out.[33] For this election, 27 million people were
eligible to vote.[34] Fifty-five percent of them were women, while voter
registration was highest among those aged between 30 and 39 years old.[35]
Only 58% of the country's registered voters voted in the election.

## Electoral system

[edit]

South Africa has a parliamentary system of government. The president of South
Africa is unusual among heads of state of countries with a parliamentary
system in that the head of government, who holds executive powers, is titled
president and also plays the ceremonial role of head of state.

In June 2020, the Constitutional Court ruled in _New Nation Movement NPC v
President of the Republic of South Africa_ that the Electoral Act was
unconstitutional to the extent that it did not allow independents to contest
national and provincial elections.[36] Since the first elections held under
universal suffrage, 400 members elected were elected to the National Assembly
by a system of proportional representation with a closed list approach. Two
hundred members were elected from national party lists, while the other 200
were elected from provincial party lists in each of the nine provinces. The
national list seats were awarded by subtracting seats won at the provincial
level from each party's national allocation to generate a maximally
proportional result. The Droop quota variant of the largest remainder method
was used to allocate seats at both the national and provincial levels.[37]
Provincial legislatures were also elected by a system of proportional
representation with closed party lists.

In February 2021, home affairs minister Aaron Motsoaledi appointed a
ministerial advisory committee led by Valli Moosa to recommend a new electoral
system.[38] While the committee was divided, a slim majority of members
favoured a hybrid mixed-member proportional system, with half of the seats
elected in constituencies and the other half elected through party lists.[39]

### Regional ballot

[edit]

The regional ballot is one of the two ballots used in South Africa's national
elections, alongside the national ballot. Voters were also presented with a
third ballot, a single ballot used for the election of members of the nine
provincial legislatures, held on the same day. The regional ballot is used to
elect representatives to the National Assembly from each of the country's nine
provinces. The regional ballot is proportional, meaning that seats are
allocated to parties and independent candidates based on the number of votes
received.[40]

National Assembly regional seats:[41]

Region  | Seats   
---|---  
Eastern Cape | 25   
Free State | 10   
Gauteng | 47   
KwaZulu-Natal | 41   
Limpopo | 20   
Mpumalanga | 15   
North West | 13   
Northern Cape | 5   
Western Cape | 24   
Total  | 200   
  
### Election of the National Assembly and provincial legislatures

[edit]

On 17 April 2023, president Cyril Ramaphosa signed the South African Electoral
Amendment Bill into law allowing independent candidates to stand for election
to the National Assembly and provincial legislatures while keeping
proportional representation with closed lists. Two hundred members will be
elected from national party lists, while the remaining 200 seats will be
contested by political parties and independent candidates in each of the nine
provinces. In provincial legislatures, the single-tier multimember
proportional system will continue to apply, with political parties and
independent candidates contesting for seats. Voters will receive three ballot
papers as opposed to two in previous elections; the first ballot will be to
elect the 200 members of the National Assembly only contested by political
parties; the second ballot will be to elect the remaining 200 members of the
National Assembly, which will be contested by political parties and
independent candidates in each of the nine provinces; and the third ballot
will be to elect members of the provincial legislatures with political parties
and independent candidates as well.[42]

### Election of the president and premiers

[edit]

Following the election, the president of South Africa was elected by the
National Assembly. Although the president is required to be a member of the
National Assembly at the time of election, a person who is elected as
president must resign their seat in order to assume office.[43] The premiers
of each province will also be elected by the respective provincial
legislatures after the election.[37]

### NCOP elections

[edit]

The National Council of Provinces (NCOP) comprises 90 members, ten of whom are
elected by each of the provincial legislatures in proportion to the
composition of the legislature. The NCOP members will be sworn in the day
after the first sitting of the National Assembly.[37]

## Parties and candidates

[edit]

Main article: Party lists for the 2024 South African election

The election saw 70 political parties register, the highest number for a
general election in South Africa. It is also the first general election to
allow independent candidates to run for the National Assembly.[34]

### Preliminary candidate lists

[edit]

On 26 March 2024, the Independent Electoral Commission published the
preliminary candidate lists, listing the following fifty-two parties as having

### Final candidate lists and independent candidates

[edit]

On 10 April 2024, the Independent Electoral Commission published the final
candidate lists, again listing fifty-two parties as having national
compensatory candidates (as opposed to national regional and provincial). The
Independent South African National Civic Organisation no longer appeared on
the list, whereas the Africa Restoration Alliance was added.[45] Six
independent candidates appeared on the national regional lists, namely Zackie
Achmat, Louis Liebenberg, Anele Mda, Lovemore N'dou, Ntakadzeni Phathela, and
Lehlohonolo Ramoba.[46]

## Campaign issues

[edit]

### Healthcare

[edit]

On 15 May 2024, two weeks before the election, president Ramaphosa signed the
National Health Insurance (NHI) Act into law, establishing a National Health
Insurance state fund to provide more South Africans access to private
healthcare.[47] The goal of the bill is to eventually phase out the use of
private healthcare, replacing it with the NHI as the sole purchaser and
provider of health insurance. The DA is staunchly opposed to the bill on the
premise that it could lead to large tax increases and corruption by ANC "cadre
deployment," and have promised to challenge it in court.[48][49]

The bill has been controversial because it would limit the ability for people
to take out private health insurance to cover medical costs. Additionally, the
government has not released official statistics regarding how much the NHI
program would cost, raising concerns it could exacerbate South Africa's
ongoing troubles providing public services such as electricity and
water.[50][48][49]

### Illegal immigration

[edit]

The South African public has blamed many socioeconomic problems on illegal
immigration.[51] Several parties such as ActionSA, IFP, ATM and PA,[52] call
for tighter border controls in response to the perceived strain caused by
undocumented migrants on public services and resources.[53][54][55] This is a
widely popular stance, with the country having historically struggled with
xenophobic vigilante violence (e.g. Operation Dudula).[56]

### Corruption

[edit]

Main articles: Corruption in South Africa and The Judicial Commission of
Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture

The Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture, known
colloquially as the Zondo Commission, completed its work and submitted its
final report to the president in June 2022.[57] The Commission cost the South
African taxpayer "almost R1 billion".[58] Investigator Paul Holden of Shadow
World Investigations read into evidence that state capture cost the South
African economy at least R49 billion.[59]

In their 2024 election manifesto, the African National Congress claims that,
as per the Zondo Commission's recommendations, "laws, institutions and
practices are being put in place to reduce the potential for corruption of any
sort and on any scale".[60] The Democratic Alliance puts the blame for
corruption and state capture squarely on the shoulders of the ANC, saying that
it will "establish a genuinely independent anti-crime and anti-corruption unit
by dissolving the Hawks and establishing a new Chapter 9 institution, an Anti-
Corruption Commission, which will only be accountable to the Parliament of
South Africa."[61] The Economic Freedom Fighters proposes to amend the
Constitution to "make the National Prosecuting Authority a Chapter 9
institution accountable to Parliament".[62]

The ANC was also criticized for provisionally including four ministers (Zizi
Kodwa, Malusi Gigaba, David Mahlobo, and Gwede Mantashe) who were implicated
in a corruption investigation into the administration of former president
Jacob Zuma on 11 March, pending the final results of an intraparty review.
Fourteen other officials were either disqualified or not listed as candidates
by the ANC over the same issue.[63]

### Land reform

[edit]

Main article: Land reform in South Africa

The ANC's proposed amendment of section 25 of the constitution of South Africa
which failed in the Parliament of South Africa, by a vote of 204 MPs in
favour, 145 MPs against and 0 abstentions.[64] The bill required a two-thirds
majority. The constitutionality of the amendment was also questioned by civil
society organisations as it attempted to implement land expropriation without
compensation.[65][66] The ANC maintains that expropriation without
compensation is necessary, as does the EFF.[67] The DA, the Freedom Front
Plus, the ACDP and the IFP remain opposed to the ANC's renewed attempt at
expropriation through the Expropriation Amendment Bill.[68][69]

Moves towards expropriation without compensation are largely framed as
solutions to racial injustice.[70] Reports from the South African government
indicate that whites own 72% of total farms of agricultural holdings,[71]
while black South Africans are generally only responsible for between 5 and
10% of the country's agricultural output.[72]

The ANC sees the current policy as a continuation of Nelson Mandela's promise
to return 30% of the land to black South Africans. Currently, the ANC hopes to
accomplish the goal by 2030.[73] In their election manifesto, the ANC claims
that they will "accelerate land reform and redistribution to reduce asset
inequality and protect security of tenure, improve food security and
agricultural production, promote rural and urban development and enable
greater access to housing."[74]

The EFF shares a similar stance to that of the ANC. In their manifesto, the
EFF outlines seven pillars on which they are basing their policies. The first
is explicitly in favor of expropriation, reading "expropriation of South
Africa's land without compensation for equal redistribution in use."[75] On
the issue of expropriation, the EFF and ANC are mostly unified. Julius Malema,
leader of the EFF, asserted that "when we say economic freedom, we mean Black
people own productive farms."[76]

The DA opposes the policy of expropriation without compensation and sees
attempts at expropriation as violating section 25 of the Constitution. Section
25 states that land may only be expropriated with compensation if the
expropriation is in the public interest.[77] The party has called attempts to
pass expropriation legislation "ruinous," an "assault on our constitutional
values," and "archaic."[78]

### Energy crisis

[edit]

Main article: South African energy crisis

Rolling blackouts, or "loadshedding", caused by problems with the state
utility Eskom have been occurring since 2007, however the prevalence of
blackouts has increased substantially since 2020.[79] There is general
dissatisfaction with the ANC's handling of the blackouts, with a 2023 survey
finding that 24% of voters who had previously supported the ANC were planning
to switch to other parties if the issue was not resolved.[80]

The parties have taken varying stances on the issue. The ANC has pledged to
create 12.5 million new jobs, a large portion of which will be devoted to a
clean energy transition and modernisation of the nation's electrical system.
The ANC has also linked the blackouts and energy crisis to environmental
justice and climate change, claiming that its energy transition platform is
also part of a larger transition to a cleaner economy.[81] According to the
ANC's election manifesto, the party pledges to "cultivate partnerships to
expand domestic industries with significant potential to create sustainable
jobs... such as energy."[74] Additionally, the party views a clean energy
transition as essential in solving the energy crisis. Part of this transition
is moving away from the coal-based electrical grid that is currently facing
loadshedding.[82] That being said, the ANC has shown historical resistance to
transitioning to new energy sources (i.e. renewables).[83]

The DA largely blames the ANC for the energy crisis, saying that the state
uses an "outdated" model of control and regulation. The DA intends to reduce
government control over the energy sector if it is able to form a government.
Using the Western Cape as a case study, the DA says it has a successful
platform for energy solutions. They argue that recent contracts to build new
solar plants in the area are indicative of this.[84] Much of their energy
platform has to do with deregulation and reducing taxes on private
entities.[85]

The EFF takes a Marxist and black nationalist approach to the issue. The party
calls for the end of the privatization of Eskom, while calling for the
involvement of the private sector in new electricity generation as part of
efforts to shift control to the "majority of black people."[75]

### Crime

[edit]

Main article: Crime in South Africa

According to the South African Police Service Crime Statistics for Quarter 2
of the 2023–24 financial year, reported contact crimes (defined by SAPS as
"crimes against the person") has increased by 3 391 (2.1%) compared to the
previous year.[86] Recorded attempted murder illustrated the highest increase
year-on-year, with 12.3%.[86] Total contact crimes reported for the quarter
are 165,909. The murder rate correlates to 77 people murdered per day, while
160 cases of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm are reported over
the same period.[87] Prior to the election, political violence was reportedly
on the rise, especially in KwaZulu-Natal.[88]

Action Society notes that "if the current murder trend continues, at least
31,000 people will be killed in the next 12 months...the [South African
Government] has lost control..."[89]

### Housing

[edit]

Main article: Land reform in South Africa

The lack of adequate housing has been a major issue.[90] According to a report
from Parliament, dated May 2022, the human settlements sector had a total of
3.4 million housing units built since 1994. The respective provinces and
municipalities delivered a separate 1.3 million "serviced sites".[91] A
parliamentary question to the Minister of Human Settlements revealed there
were 2,456,773 households registered on the National Housing Needs Register as
of February 2023.[92] In the City of Cape Town, there were 375,150 on the
municipalities' Housing Needs Register.[93]

In answer to a Parliamentary question to the Minister of Human Settlements on
24 March 2024, she stated that her department had built 245,587 houses in the
five years between January 2019 and January 2024.[94]

### Cadre deployment

[edit]

The ANC has practised a policy of employing people who are loyal to the ANC to
positions within institutions of government. The Zondo Commission has found
that cadre deployment played a significant part in corruption and went as far
as to say that it is "illegal and unconstitutional".[95]

On 12 February 2024, the Constitutional Court ruled that the ANC had five days
to hand over their cadre deployment records to the Democratic Alliance dating
back to 1 January 2013.[96] Documents released by the DA so far contain a
sworn affidavit from Thapelo Masilela, a Strategic Support Manager in the
Office of the ANC Deputy Secretary General's Office which states that a laptop
containing information in relation to the Deployment Committee had "crashed
and...data which was stored on that hard drive had been lost".[97] DA Leader
John Steenhuisen responded in a press briefing on 23 February 2024 saying "the
missing laptops, the missing minutes, President Cyril Ramaphosa WhatsApp's
from his own personal devices are simply incongruent with the way in which the
modern world works",[98] showing that the party does not believe that the ANC
has entirely complied with the order of the Constitutional Court.

### Foreign policy

[edit]

Cyril Ramaphosa said that _South Africa v. Israel_ at the International Court
of Justice (ICJ) may lead to foreign interference in the general
election.[99][100]

#### The African Growth & Opportunity Act

[edit]

Main article: African Growth and Opportunity Act

South Africa's links to Russia and China, through military co-operation[101]
and potential co-operation with Iran[102] has placed the country in danger of
losing its preferential access to the U.S. market through the African Growth
and Opportunity Act, with multiple members of the U.S. Congress raising
concern with South Africa's alleged threats to U.S. interests.[103][102] In
response, the Leader of the Opposition, John Steenhuisen led a delegation
arguing that "the ANC is not South Africa" in an effort to lessen the risk of
a possible removal from AGOA.[103] Later, the Western Cape Premier, Alan Winde
and a provincial delegation also made a trip to the United States to detail
the possible impact that a loss would have on the agricultural industry in the
province.[104] The Leader of the Opposition in the Western Cape Provincial
Parliament, Cameron Dugmore (ANC) accused the provincial government of wasting
public funds, saying "this trip was about the DA's desperation to secure
support for the 2024 elections by creating a certain narrative about this
matter".[105]

### Cape independence

[edit]

Main article: Cape independence

The Freedom Front Plus and the Referendum Party contested the election with
Cape independence as part of their platform. The Referendum Party was formed
in November 2023 as a single-issue political party aiming to pressure the
Western Cape Democratic Alliance government into holding a referendum on
Western Cape independence as part of any potential coalition agreement.[106]
The Cape Independence Party, which had contested in 2009 and 2019, did not
make it on to the national ballot or the Western Cape provincial ballot, while
the Referendum Party made it on to all three.[107][108][109]

## Highly contested provinces

[edit]

### Gauteng

[edit]

Gauteng is the most populated province and is the _de facto_ economic hub of
South Africa. In 2019 the ANC had barely retained the province, getting 50.19%
of the vote. The DA hoped to win Gauteng with Solly Msimanga as their premier
candidate.[110] Funzi Ngobeni was ActionSA's premier candidate,[111] while the
ANC's candidate was current premier, Panyaza Lesufi.

The ANC lost its majority in Gauteng, claiming under 35% of the vote, followed
by the DA with just over 28%.

### KwaZulu-Natal

[edit]

KwaZulu-Natal is the second most populated province and is home to the busiest
port in southern Africa. Recent polling has the new MK Party leading in the
province, having grown substantially at the expense of ANC support.
Christopher Pappas is the premier candidate for the DA, while Thami Ntuli was
the IFP's candidate.[112][113] The ANC's premier candidate is Sbongiseni Duma.
MK took 45.9% of the vote, leaving the ANC with only 17.6%, the DA not far
behind.

### Western Cape

[edit]

As of April 2024, the Western Cape was the only province not to be controlled
by the ANC. The DA, which has controlled the province since 2009, looked to
retain the province with Premier Alan Winde as their premier candidate.[114]

The DA retained control of the Western Cape with a 53% majority.

## Incidents

[edit]

### DA campaign video

[edit]

In May 2024, the DA released a campaign video attacking the ANC and showing a
South African flag on fire, saying that the same fate would befall the country
should the ANC remain in power. The flag appears restored in the final seven
seconds of the advert. DA leader John Steenhuisen described the video as "the
most successful political advertisement in our democratic history," saying
that it was seen by at least four million people online and heard by "millions
more" in other media. President and ANC leader Cyril Ramaphosa called the ad
"despicable" and "treasonous", while the public broadcaster SABC announced
that it would not air the video, saying that it would only fuel "outrage", and
called on the DA to amend the advert.[115][116] Several analysts and
organisations have noted that, although in "poor taste", the burning of the
flag is protected under Section 16 of the Constitution as a freedom of
expression.[117]

The Complaints and Compliance Committee of the Independent Communications
Authority of South Africa ruled on 24 May that the SABC be directed to desist
from not airing the advert and pay a R500,000 fine within seven days.[118]

### National Health Insurance

[edit]

President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on 13 May that he would sign the
controversial National Health Insurance Bill into law on 15 May.[119] Civil
society organisations, including the South African Medical Association,
Business Unity South Africa, Business Leadership South Africa, Solidariteit,
the SA Institute of Race Relations and the South African Health Professionals
Collaboration have expressed dissatisfaction at this announcement, some
hinting at possible legal challenges to the legislation following the
president's assent.[120][121][122][123] The DA announced that it had briefed
its legal team to file court papers at the Constitutional Court on the
matter.[124] ActionSA expressed its disappointment on the president's
announcement, having previously urged the President not to sign the Bill.[125]

### Jacob Zuma

[edit]

Former President Jacob Zuma founded the uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK Party) in
December 2023, intending to contest the election.[126] On 20 May 2024, the
Constitutional Court of South Africa ruled that Zuma is ineligible to run in
the parliamentary election due to his 2021 jail sentence.[127]

### Presidential Address to the Nation

[edit]

On 26 May, the Presidency announced that Cyril Ramaphosa would address the
nation at 6pm.[128] In his address, broadcast by the SABC, he listed the
achievements of his government. The address was criticised by opposition
parties as an abuse of government resources for electioneering in favour of
the ruling party.[129]

## Conduct

[edit]

Early voting for overseas citizens was held in South African diplomatic
missions on 17 and 18 May.[34][132] Early voting for domestic voters was held
on 27 May, covering 1.6 million people including essential workers and about
624,000 people unable to leave their homes.[133] On election day, polling in
more than 23,000 precincts[134] opened at 07:00 and closed at 21:00.[135]
Three thousand SANDF soldiers were deployed to ensure security during the
election, while the Independent Electoral Commission said two people were
arrested for interfering with voting operations.[136] Julius Malema voted in
Limpopo after queuing for three hours.[137] Counting was delayed in several
precincts due to last-minute queues of voters,[138] with the last ballots
being cast at around 03:00 on 30 May as electoral law allows those still
lining up to vote at regular closing time to participate.[139]

The African Union sent a mission led by former Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta
to monitor the election.[140] The voting was described as free and fair by the
IEC and independent observers.[141]

## Results

[edit]

Main article: Results of the 2024 South African general election

The election resulted in a historic defeat for the ANC, which having received
only 40% of the vote, lost the parliamentary majority that it held since
1994.[142][143] It also failed to secure a majority in Northern Cape and
Gauteng, and was outpolled in KwaZulu-Natal by the MK. In overseas voting, the
DA won 75.23% of the 39,084 votes cast and retained its majority in the
Western Cape.[144] The ANC retained reduced majorities in Eastern Cape, Free
State, Limpopo, Mpumalanga and North West and retained largest opposition
status in Western Cape, while the DA retained its largest opposition status in
the National Assembly. No overall majority was achieved in the National
Assembly, nor in the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng or Northern Cape,
with the MK achieving a plurality in KwaZulu-Natal and the ANC being forced
into second-largest party status in KwaZulu-Natal for the first time since it
first won the province in 2004.[145] Most of the ANC's loss of support flowed
into the MK, while the DA saw some gains, and the EFF lost some support.[146]

### Provincial legislatures

elections.svg.png)Provincial election results

The ANC won seven provinces out of nine, securing majorities in five of them
except for the Northern Cape[147] and Gauteng,[148] where it earned
pluralities. It performed best in Limpopo, the country's northernmost
province, winning slightly less than three quarters of the vote.[149] The DA
held on to the Western Cape, continuing its 15-year-rule over the
province.[150] Finally, the new MK party flipped KwaZulu Natal from the ANC,
earning 37 out of 80 seats to gain a plurality. [151]

### National Council of Provinces

[edit]

Results for the National Council of Provinces will be available once they are
elected at the first sitting of each provincial legislature.[37]

## Aftermath

[edit]

Main articles: Third Cabinet of Cyril Ramaphosa, 28th South African
Parliament, and 2024 South African presidential election

While counting was ongoing, the ANC said that its leadership would meet on 31
May to "reflect on what is good for the country." The DA's John Steenhuisen
said that the results showed that South Africa was "heading into coalition
country" and expressed a willingness to work alongside the ANC, adding that he
would have to first consult with other signatories of the Multi-Party
Charter.[152] The DA also said that a government composed of the ANC, the MK,
and the EFF would be a "doomsday coalition" pursuing previous policy failures
in the country. The EFF's Julius Malema said that the election results marked
the end of the ANC's "entitlement of being the sole dominant party", adding
that he was open to talks with the ANC on forming a coalition government. The
Patriotic Alliance's Gayton McKenzie compared prospects of an ANC-DA coalition
to "a marriage of two drunk people in Las Vegas" that would prove
"unworkable".[153]

Gwede Mantashe, the ANC's national chair, said that the party had started to
conduct informal talks with other parties for a possible coalition.[154] On 2
June, ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula announced the official opening of
negotiations,[155] adding that the party had heard the popular will and was
"humbled" by the election result. Mbalula also said that the ANC would reject
conditions by other parties for Cyril Ramaphosa to step down as
president.[156] In his first statement following the election later that day,
Ramaphosa called on political parties to overcome their differences and find
"common ground" in creating a coalition government.[157] Separate coalition
talks were expected to occur regarding the provincial governments of KwaZulu-
Natal, Gauteng and Northern Cape.[158][159][160]

On 4 June, the ANC released an internal document which advised for a coalition
with both the DA and IFP. The document also stated that the ANC "should not
consider" an alliance with either the EFF or the MK.[161] On 5 June, the ANC
formally announced that it was seeking to create a national unity government,
with spokesperson Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri saying that the party had
discussions with the DA, the EFF and three other smaller parties, but received
no positive response from the MK.[162][163] These discussions, which were
still in the early stages, will continue, with the ANC framing them as an
attempt to form a government of "national unity" and not just as an option for
a formal coalition.[163] On 6 June, the MK confirmed that it was engaged in
negotiations with the ANC.[164] On 12 June, the IFP said that it was willing
to join a unity government that included the ANC and the DA.[165] On 13 June,
the ANC announced that the DA and several other parties had agreed on the
“fundamental” principle of forming the national unity government, with a
framework to be disclosed on 14 June.[166] On 14 June, John Steenhuisen
announced that the DA had entered into a coalition agreement with the ANC and
provided its support for Ramaphosa's reelection as president. The Patriotic
Alliance also provided its support.[167] This coalition agreement was also
confirmed by ANC secretary general Fikile Mbalula, who described it as a
"remarkable step."[4] The "fundamental" principles of what was to become a
grand coalition was set by a written agreement dated 17 June 2024 between ANC
and DA, referred to as the Statement of Intent.[168]

On 6 June, ActionSA announced they would leave the Multi-Party Charter as the
party believed some member parties had breached the agreement by considering
forming a coalition with the ANC.[31] This decision reduced the charter's seat
count from 119 to 113 in the 400-seat National Assembly.[169]

### First sitting of parliament

[edit]

On 10 June, Chief Justice Raymond Zondo declared that the first sitting of the
new National Assembly would occur on 14 June, during which elections for
parliamentary speaker and president would be held.[170] The session proceeded
as scheduled, with the ANC's Thoko Didiza being elected parliamentary speaker
after she defeated the Economic Freedom Fighters' Veronica Mente with 284
votes to 49.[171][172][173] The same day, the National Assembly re-elected
Ramaphosa as President of South Africa after defeating Economic Freedom
Fighters leader Julius Malema with 283 votes to 54.[174][5] The DA's Annelie
Lotriet was elected Deputy Speaker after defeating the African Transformation
Movement's Vuyo Zungula with 273 votes to 54.[175] Lotriet became the first
non-ANC member to hold the position of Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly
since Bhadra Ranchod,[176] who served as Deputy Speaker between 1994 and
1996.[177]

On the same day, the ANC, the DA, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the
Patriotic Alliance (PA), agreed to form a national unity government, with
Cyril Ramaphosa being re-elected President of South Africa.[178][179] He was
sworn in as president on 19 June while negotiations on the cabinet were
ongoing.

In an interview on SABC News' _Face the Nation_ current affairs programme, DA
Federal Council Chairperson Helen Zille said in reference to the Patriotic
Alliance admission: "So you can't just let anybody come in without consulting
with us and then he makes the appointments in consultation with the leaders of
the parties who have been accepted for admission".[180] Zille specifically
referred to Clause 17 of the Statement of Intent, which governs the
President's powers in appointing an Executive. Clauses 18 and 19 of the
statement deal with the concept of "sufficient consensus", which among other
points, only exists when "parties to the GNU representing 60% of the seats in
the National Assembly agree".[181]

Other parties to join the national unity government are GOOD, shortly after
the first sitting of parliament, the PAC, on the 19th, and the FF+ on the 20th
of June. The UDM decided to join on the 21st, Rise Mzansi on the 22nd, Al
Jama-ah on the 23rd, and UAT on the 30th of June 2024.[182][183] This brought
the GNU to 288 seats in the 400 seat parliament (72%). On 12 July 2024 the UAT
withdrew from the GNU, because it did not receive any positions in the
Cabinet.[184] This does not adjust the 72% of GNU seats in parliament.

The DA reportedly requested 10 posts in the cabinet, including the ministries
of Communication and digital technology, Trade and industry, Transport, Public
service and administration, Water and sanitation, Local government and Health,
as well as deputy minister posts of finance and health. In addition, the DA
requested that John Steenhuisen be designated as deputy president over ANC
incumbent Paul Mashatile. The ANC rejected most of the requests on the grounds
of multiple other parties joining the coalition negotiations, instead agreeing
to up to five cabinet positions for the DA. The DA's negotiators, including
Steenhuisen and Tony Leon, considered withdrawing, but instead agreed to keep
negotiations open with the ANC.[185][186]

On 30 June, Ramaphosa unveiled his new 32-member cabinet, with the ANC holding
20 posts, the DA holding six, and the remainder being held by other coalition
members. John Steenhuisen was appointed as agriculture minister, while the
leaders of four other parties were also named ministers.[187] In addition, 42
deputy ministers were named from among the coalition parties.

In the 6th Parliament's final session, the National Assembly voted to
establish the Electoral Reform Consultation Panel to independently investigate
and recommend potential reforms to South Africa's electoral system.[188]

## Provincial formations

[edit]

Despite gains in KwaZulu-Natal province during the general election, Jacob
Zuma's MK party suffered a major setback in its heartland province on 14 June
after the KwaZulu-Natal provincial legislative opted to elect IFP member Thami
Ntuli over an MK candidate as Premier of KwaZulu-Natal.[189][190] Ntuli
defeated the MK Party's premier candidate, Zulu Nation's deputy prime minister
Phathisizwe Chiliza, with 41 votes to 39.[191] Ntuli took office and appointed
his cabinet on 18 June,[192] making him the first IFP member to serve as
Premier of KwaZulu-Natal since 2004.[193]

### Allegations of misconduct

[edit]

On 1 June, Jacob Zuma said that the MK was seeking to have the announcement of
official results legally halted pending investigations over allegations of
vote-rigging raised by the party, with MK officials citing possible tampering
of the Independent Electoral Commission's computer system following glitches
earlier that day. The IEC said it had received 579 objections from both voters
and political parties regarding the election results,[194] and ordered
recounts in 24 cases.[155] Police Minister Bheki Cele warned that authorities
would not tolerate "threats of instability in order to register objections or
concerns about the electoral processes".[195]

The MK later filed a petition asking the Constitutional Court to halt the
opening session of the new National Assembly on 14 June,[196] adding that it
would boycott the meeting.[197] On 13 June, the Constitutional Court dismissed
the petition, allowing the session to proceed.[198] The MK continued to
boycott parliamentary proceedings until 26 June, when its MPs finally took
their oath as members of the National Assembly.[199]
