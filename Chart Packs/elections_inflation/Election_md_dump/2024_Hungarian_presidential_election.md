## Background

[edit]

Further information: Katalin Novák presidential pardon scandal

On 10 February 2024 President Katalin Novák announced her resignation
(effective upon approval by Parliament) over the controversial pardon of a
vice principal of a foster home in Bicske, who tried to cover up the
principal's crimes when the latter was charged for child molestation.[1] The
vice principal's pardon became known to the public on 2 February 2024, after
which protests demanding Novák's resignation took place.[2]

The opposition alliance United for Hungary called for the direct election of
the President of the Republic in their manifesto for the 2022 parliamentary
election, which would require amending or replacing the current
constitution.[3] On 25 February, opposition parties held a rally in Budapest
calling for direct presidential elections.[4]

On 26 February the National Assembly formally accepted Novák's resignation,
leading to the termination of her mandate.[5]

## Electoral system

[edit]

Under the current Constitution of Hungary adopted by the Fidesz–KDNP
government coalition in 2011, the President of the Republic is elected via
secret ballot by the National Assembly, no sooner than sixty but no later than
thirty days before expiry of the mandate (five years) of the previous office-
holder, or if their mandate terminated prematurely, within thirty days of the
termination. The constitution authorizes the Speaker of the National Assembly
to set the date for the election.[6]

A presidential candidate needs the written nomination of at least one-fifth of
the Members of Parliament (thus 40 MPs), who may not nominate more than one
candidate.[6] In the first round of the election, a two-thirds majority of all
incumbent MPs is required to elect the president. If this condition is not
fulfilled, a second round is held between the two candidates who received the
highest and second highest numbers of votes in the first round. (Since 1990,
there have been no more than two candidates in any presidential election.) A
simple majority of the voting MPs is then sufficient. If only one candidate is
nominated, the assembly votes on whether to confirm or reject their election
to the presidency, with each MP being allowed to vote either for or against,
but not to cast their vote for an alternative candidate.[6]
