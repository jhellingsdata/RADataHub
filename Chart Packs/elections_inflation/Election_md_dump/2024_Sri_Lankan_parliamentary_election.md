**Parliamentary elections** in Sri Lanka are scheduled for 14 November 2024 to
elect 225 members to the new parliament. The 16th Parliament of Sri Lanka was
dissolved on 24 September 2024. Following the election, the newly elected
parliament is expected to convene on 21 November 2024.[2][3][4]

The submission of nominations for the upcoming election commenced on 4 October
and concluded on 11 October 2024 at 12:00 SLST.[5][6]

## Background

[edit]

### Political landscape before the election

[edit]

The Sri Lanka People's Freedom Alliance (SLPFA), led by Mahinda Rajapaksa, won
a large majority in the 2020 Sri Lankan parliamentary election on 5 August
2020.[7] During their tenure, the government under President Gotabaya
Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa faced multiple crises,
including the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic crisis, widespread protests, and
the 2022 Sri Lankan political crisis.[8]

These events led to Gotabaya Rajapaksa fleeing the country and resigning as
president, while Mahinda Rajapaksa also stepped down as prime minister.[9][10]
Ranil Wickremesinghe was first appointed as prime minister and later became
the acting president following Gotabaya Rajapaksa's resignation. In a
parliamentary vote on 20 July 2024, Wickremesinghe was elected as Sri Lanka's
9th president, tasked with completing the remainder of Rajapaksa's term.[11]

In the 2024 Sri Lankan presidential election held on 21 September 2024, Anura
Kumara Dissanayake defeated his main rivals, Opposition Leader Sajith
Premadasa and incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, to become the new
President of Sri Lanka.[12]

As per the Parliamentary Elections Act, No. 1 of 1981, although the Sri Lankan
parliament has a term of five years, the president can dissolve it after two
years and six months from its first meeting or upon receiving a resolution
from parliament. In spite of the scheduled end in August 2025, President
Dissanayake, exercising his constitutional powers and fulfilling an election
pledge, dissolved parliament on 21 September 2024.[13][14][15]

### Election schedule

21 November 2024  | Thursday  | First meeting of the new Parliament of Sri Lanka for the formal election of the Speaker.[3]  
  
## Electoral system

[edit]

See also: Elections in Sri Lanka and List of parliamentary elections in Sri
Lanka

The Parliament has 225 members elected for a five-year term. 196 members are
elected from 22 multi-seat constituencies through an open list proportional
representation with a 5% electoral threshold; voters can rank up to three
candidates on the party list they vote for.[20] The other 29 seats are elected
from a national list, with list members appointed by party secretaries and
seats allocated according to the island-wide proportional vote the party
obtains.

Every proclamation dissolving parliament must be published in the _The Sri
Lanka Gazette_ and must specify the nomination period and the date of the
election. The first meeting of the new parliament must occur within three
months of the previous parliament's dissolution.[21]

### Recent changes in seat allocation

[edit]

Sri Lanka

On 25 September 2024, the Election Commission released details regarding the
number of members to be elected from each electoral district in the upcoming
parliamentary election, the number of candidates to be listed on the
nomination paper, and the deposit amount required from independent groups.
Recognised political parties are exempt from making a deposit.[1][22][23]

## Election campaign

[edit]

### Campaign finances

[edit]

#### Candidate asset declaration

[edit]

Under the Anti-Corruption Act, No. 9 of 2023, all election candidates are
required to submit a Declaration of Assets and Liabilities to the Commissioner
of Elections along with their nomination papers, covering assets and
liabilities up to the date the election is announced. Candidates seeking
national list nominations must also submit their declarations.[41][42]

#### Expenditure cap and regulations

[edit]

On 17 October 2024, the Election Commission issued a circular setting the
maximum campaign spending limit for candidates in the 2024 General Election.
This cap applies to candidates, political parties, independent groups, and
national list candidates, and is determined by district.[43][44]

These regulations are enforced under the Regulation of Election Expenditure
Act, No. 3 of 2023. Parties must submit expenditure reports to the Election
Commission within 21 days of the election results being declared.[45]

### Election campaigning activities

[edit]

Election campaigning will end at 24:00 SLST on 11 November 2024. A silence
period will then be enforced until election day on 14 November 2024, during
which all campaign activities are prohibited.[19]

## Controversies

[edit]

### Rejection of nomination papers

[edit]

YouTuber Ashen Senarathna announced his candidacy for the Sri Lankan
Parliament, seeking to represent the Colombo electoral district as part of an
independent group. On 11 October 2024, the Election Commission rejected his
nomination, citing that it was submitted by an unauthorised individual, which
led to disqualification. Senarathna plans to take legal action, claiming he
was asked to wait outside while another candidate submitted the
nomination.[46]

### Removal of name from the nomination list

[edit]

Actress Damitha Abeyratne was expected to contest the general elections from
the Ratnapura electoral district under the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB)
ticket. However, her name did not appear on the list of candidates submitted
by the SJB to the District Secretariat. Hesha Vithanage, the SJB leader for
Ratnapura, stated that the decision to exclude her name was made by district
members.[47]

### Withdrawal from contesting election

[edit]

On 12 October 2024, former MP Ajith Mannapperuma withdrew from the
parliamentary elections and resigned from Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), a day
after submitting his nomination for the Gampaha electoral district. He cited
his removal as SJB chief organiser for the Gampaha electorate. He also
expressed disappointment with party leader Sajith Premadasa and his
leadership.[48][49]

## Voting

[edit]

### Postal voting

[edit]

The Election Commission initially accepted postal voting applications from 1–8
October 2024, later extending the deadline to 24:00 SLST on 10 October 2024.
The postal voting facility is exclusively available to pre-approved officials
involved in election duties.[16][17]

Approved individuals began casting their votes on 30 October 2024. The postal
voting process will follow the schedule set by the Election Commission, with
voting continuing on 1 November, 4 November, and 7–8 November 2024.[18]
